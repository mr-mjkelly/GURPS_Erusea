# GURPS ErusÃ«a Fantasy Campaign Milieu

## Introduction

Setting up the environment for developing and managing a campaign milieu. This is the basic README for the structure of this environment and its associated components.
## Obsidian MD vault folder structure
- Note that folder structure is separate from the document organization for the overall source material in the campaign, which will be created and managed via linked file organization, tagging, etc.
### \_inbox

This is the initial landing zone for all input into the vault. From here, decide and process the file, note, whatever into more developed parts of the milieu source material. Tags for items in editing or playtesting should be tagged as well as placed in the correct folder.
### 0 - Old Vault Contents
This is a stash of old content from an earlier vault. It will be mined for ideas, etc., and gradually deprecated.
### 1 - Notes
This is the high-level folder structure for the written material for the milieu.
#### 1.1 - Editing
Here be drafts and fragments. The pre-play or use versions of all things, from background material to homebrew rules to adventure settings can start here or be migrated from the \_inbox folder and worked to perfection&mdash;or at least readiness for playtesting and other preliminary evaluation.
#### 1.2 - Playtesting
Documents ready for initial play migrate from `1.1 - Editing` to here. Additional editing may certainly continue, but at this point such editing would be identified by tagging rather than by returning to the editing folder.
#### 1.3 - Production
The final repository for material that is finished, at least until some future revision.
#### 1.4 - Rules
Game rules and information in tables and text from various sources.
#### 1.5 Bibliographical Notes
Notes with information about books used in the design and ongoing work for this campaign milieu.
### 2 - Files
Files other than Obsidian MD Markdown notes.
#### 2.1 Docs
Documents in formats other than Obsidian MD Markdown notes.
##### 2.1.1 PDFs
PDF files, including reference materials such as the core rules, commercial modules, and other supplements go here.
##### 2.1.2 Non-PDF
Documents in formats other than PDF that are not Markdown notes go here.
##### 2.2 - Graphics
Art, photos, maps, etc. are stored here.
##### 2.3 - Audio_Video
