# The Kialti

After [[The Fall|the fall]] the various [[Kialti]] tribes and clans in the circle of imperial ([[Ilinar|Ilinaran]]?) influence started being pressed by the less civilized tribes beyond their realms. Trolls, giants, and other non-humans also started encroaching on [[Kialti]] lands until only a few strong kings remained, a high kingdom rose and fell (more than once?).

- The [[Danar]], while related to the [[Kialti]] to some extent, and certainly civilized in their own right, were never really aligned with the [[Ilinar|Ilinaran]] realms, particular during the imperial age. They receded, even retreated to their strongholds in the north and west.

# The Aldrans

- The [[Aldrans]] are a hardy people and those of their kind who journeyed across the sea and began settling were warriors and adventurers.
- Aldrans knew of the lands of the west from trade. Many Aldrans served lords and merchants as guards, soldiers, even slavers. Because of their contact with the eastern remnants of the Ilinaran Empire, they were militarily skilled and sophisticated.
	- Use of horse in the sense of light cavalry: mounted combat from a saddle, including lance, sword and shield; and limited use of the short bow.
	- For the most part, the Kialti use horses only for transportation (in fact, they do not use them for agriculture, which the Aldrans actually do). Occasionally a lord will ride a chariot into battle, but normally the chariot engages in combat against another lord in a sort of ritualistic duel. Normally, lords either command from their chariot, or dismount and fight in the melee with their fellow warriors.
	- Aldrans are soldiers, as opposed to warriors. Young fighting-aged nobles are the mounted cavalry and serve as officers. They typically lead bands of mounted cavalry who, while not land-owning nobility, are still among the military elite and serve as both the rapid strike forces of the Aldran military, as well as personal guards and escorts for their lords. The bulk of the Aldran military are a mix of heavy foot (chainmail, shield, sword, and axe), light levies (yeomanry from freehold farms) in leather or light chain shirts, spear, and long knife (short swords). Archers are drawn from the levies, and double as skirmishers when the tactical situation requires. The organization of these foot soldiers is rank and file, and includes ranks such as sergeant and corporal, and a sort of legionary unit structure.
- As challenges to Kialti realms drew attention and resources away from the southern and eastern coasts, Aldran raids increased. Raids led to landings in force, and occupation of poorly defended or abandoned forts and settlements. As news of the opportunities for establishment of outposts reached the ears of adventurous Aldran lords, raiders became invaders and invaders became colonists.
	- Over the course of more than a century, the Aldrans established colonies. The three strongest of these became kingdoms; a fourth became a ducal principality that, while technically affiliated with an older Aldran kingdom, managed to maintain a great deal of independence due to their wealth and the payment of more than just their tribute to their parent realm.
