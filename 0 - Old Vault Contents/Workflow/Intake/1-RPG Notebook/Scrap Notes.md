## General Thoughts

This is intended to be a long running campaign. It is a hybrid between open and episodic adventure and a greater story arc.

The world has an ancient history, and has survived at least one major cataclysm that altered land and sea. Legendary ancient civilizations were lost, along with the artifacts and knowledge of ages past.

The people of the world are largely scattered, isolated, disparate and disunited. Humans are especially varied in locale, social organization, etc.

- This is not a quasi-medieval world, and few governments are feudal in nature.
    
There is a cosmic event or phenomenon that occurs every 3,700 or so years. It has various names. Different cultures, organizations, and individuals have various ideas about its origins, nature, and significance.

The initial setting of the campaign is a temperate region similar to continental Europe in many respects. The name of the land (continent) is Aluthea. A few ideas about the inhabitants of this starting region:

- The starting realms are not large. They are somewhat akin to early Celtic (Althan) and Germanic (Baragundian) kingdoms, with weak monarchs and strong warlords serving as nobility. The people are seldom in serfdom or slavery. Instead, most common folk are tenant farmers who pay rent in kind but are otherwise free folk. Some of the larger villages and most of the towns have their own local reeves or councils and towns often have at least some form of armed militia or professional soldiers. Prominent landless warlords often live in towns with their troops and other retainers, selling their services and paying for their room and board in various ways. Some of these fighting companies have a presence in more than one locale, or visit various locations over the course of a year or so.
    
- Consider the central Althean realms to be principally Althan and Baragundian realms. The Althan realms are nominally one high kingdom, but there has not been a high king for more than a century, and there are no heirs to the original royal line. Several of the Althan kings have tried for the position over time, but none gained enough support to make a strong and lasting claim. The efforts of the religious orders, druids, bards, and certain wizards to keep order and balance has prevented outright war among kingdoms. However, over time, the realms have become weaker and more divided. Kings became petty kings, lords and upstart warlords became relatively stronger. Estates, villages, and even towns fall into hard economic times and some are abandoned. The wilderness has encroached in places, along with things that thrive outside the bounds of human law and order.
    
    - Baragundian realms are nearby—to the south and east, in a region of rugged, rainy forested mountains.
        
- [[Gray elves]] dwell near human lands, some even dwell among humans in smaller, more rural and remote settlements. Most half-elves are the offspring of an elf parent living in or near humans.
    
- [[Dwarves|Dwarves]] do not dwell in human lands, but do have a system of hostels and other facilities for their travel, trade, and craft needs.
## Ideas

The cosmic phenomenon’s name? The Dragon Star. Talcaryax (attributing it to a might outer dark deity who is often depicted as a great dragon).

A very ancient cult led by an evil order of sorcerer-priests is growing more active and seeking artifacts related to bring forth a prophecy of world conquest. This cult, and its leader, Askarthus, are a long term antagonist for PCs (and the good people of the world). Askarthus is from a previous civilization (undead, immortal, just long-lived…?)

I have a murky idea about a starting adventure that begins in a somewhat known cave complex with a rumored, if not quite legendary, past. Villagers learn of a landslide on one of the mountainsides and some go to investigate, but do not return—at least not all of them. It is possible one does, and brings back something that greatly concerns a local cleric. PCs are gathered by the abbess of a nearby monastery and head off to investigate and explore.
### Some history

#### Deities

Religion in this milieu is a polytheistic mix.
- Some cultures worship various deities, some derived from even older traditions.

At some point after the last cataclysm (thus, nearly 3,700 years ago) several powerful lords rose to prominence in the world and worked to help the various people and realms recover from the ongoing tumult. They were paragons of their particular circles of activity, and some consider them demigods or even deities in their own right.
- Did these people and their followers form the Seven Kingdoms?
    - This would be the large subcontinent that dominate Middlesea.    
- What deities would these paragons have worshiped, if any?
- Over centuries, various organizations and orders formed from seeds sown by these paragons:
- This would include wizards, druids, bards, as well as some martial orders.[1](#sdfootnote1sym)
### Teleportation

Teleportation consists of two sorts: great teleportation circles, found in many places throughout the world (who knows who created them initially, but whoever it was, they also seem to have created some artifacts and great ruins, and were a civilization—or civilizations—that spread across many lands and seas. These circles operate using patterns that represent the destinations. Users start in the origin point and, if they possess the right rod or similar key item, they can travel instantly to another circle at another location.

The other sort of teleportation is less instantaneous, and is a form of travel through some infra-dimension that can shorten travel between very distant places, but requires magic to use (certain rituals, items, and times); they also have some perils within them. They feel to those traveling as if moving through wide tunnels with liquid walls that offer some indistinct views into _something, somewhere_ beyond the shimmering, wavy walls.
### The Seas

_**Farseas**_ is the general term for the “unknown” outer oceans: the “far seas” or “outer seas” are other terms. These seas beyond the shores of the “known” lands have some surreal qualities compared to the inner seas (Middlesea, Southsea, Northsea).
- Persistent storms that can last for years.
- Distorted distances and time with respect to the inner lands and seas. It is not unheard of for some seafarers to lose time while in the outer seas; conversely, some return from long voyages (or rescues from being marooned) to find that little time has passed for those ashore.
- Difficult navigation due to “strange stars” and other anomalies. Magic or some sort of special ability (such as that possessed by certain sea elves) is necessary to reliably navigate the far seas.
    
Some scholars speculate that the near seas (Middlesea, Northsea, and Southsea) were warded, sheltered, or otherwise protected or insulated from the wild Farseas unpredictability. Whether this was the work of higher powers, members of a greater civilization in a bygone era, or something inherent in the qualities of the lands and seas themselves is a matter of diverse opinion and academic debate.
