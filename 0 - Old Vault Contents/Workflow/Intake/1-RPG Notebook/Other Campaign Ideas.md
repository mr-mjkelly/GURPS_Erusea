## Kingdoms in the Sky Milieu Concept

### The General Idea

The world is a generally Earth-like planet, but warmer, and with more seas and less land. It is a geologically active world. Lots of vulcanism and geothermal activity.

The central area of the setting is a series of large islands the size of the British Isles or larger, surrounded by many — hundreds — of smaller isles and islands.

### Human civilization

Ages ago, there was a legendary greater civilization. As their realms sank beneath the rising seas, some of their kind established new colonies. Because the deep valleys, rain forests, and jungles of the new lands, they established their stronghold city-states high in well chosen mountain reaches, and dug deeply into the rock to defend themselves against the beasts from the jungles and forests below and those who fly above.

### Human not-so-much civilization

**Arkurrians** — Militant, dragon-riders and delvers. No slavery, per se, but tributary realms pay dearly to avoid reprisals or even occupation. Arkurrans deal a lot with a particularly active saurad menace. Akkuran warriors tend to spend a part of their early career as warriors errant. Black or brown hair, light brown skin, brown, hazel, or blue eyes. Tall and large-boned.

**The White Tribes** — Pale-skinned blonde or red-haired barbarians and even savages who live in the jungles and rainforests of the lower valleys.

**Wood Clans** — Tall, brawny, tough, and well-armed clans in a northern isle of forests, lakes, mountains.

**The Seafarers** — Brown-skinned; black hair, brown or occasionally red hair; brown eyes; fairly stocky build, high cheekbones, epicantic folds, etc. Uncanny knack for sailing the seas. Fisherman and raiders.

**The City Dwellers** — (I really need a name for these people.) This is the only culture that has a number of loosely associated (although by no means united) realms. The capitals of these realms are great fortified city-states built high in the mountains of one or two lands, at altitudes of 7,000 to about 10,000 feet. Although the population of these realms is diverse, the majority and certainly the aristocracy are the [name?], a tall people with bronze skin, black, brown, or blond hair, brown, hazel, or blue eyes. The rest of the population, comprising the merchant and trades (middle-class) and some of the lower classes are a mix of immigrants, descendants of tribute hostages and slaves, and resident merchants and craftspeople from other realms.

A sort of victorian-era neo-classical culture. Government is typically a king (not a queen!), a council of 25 aristocrats who are elected by members of the aristocracy, and generally represent the greater houses, an ecclesiastical council, which has a minor advisory and ceremonial role, and a plebiscite body of 100 people from the non-aristocratic classes. The military is influential, as the king is nominally its head (although it is commanded by generals who are often, but not always, aristocrats without lands or strong business interests.

## Other races

**Giants** —

→ Do the Cloud Giants actually dwell in floating castle-cities?

**Lizard folk** (_Saurads__)_ —

**Man-bats** — Winged vampiric semi-humanoids with tails.

**Troglodytes** —

**K****yr** — Winged men and women, and an elder race (or descendants of one) with exceptionally long life spans.

## Monsters

Drakes

Griffon

Harpies

Hippogriff

Roc

Wyvern

### Beasts

**Great Cats**–Tree-climbing Jaguar-like cats of various coats; Desert sabretoothed cats.

Insects and other creepy things (millipedes, centipedes)

**Great** **Arachnids** — Spider-like

Sea creatures great and small

**Serpents —**

## Miscellaneous Points to Consider:

Governments (of the core realms) —

The city-states have a dual government of king and high council, as well as a representative plebiscite

Travel across the oceans (and even some of the larger lakes) is perilous. Storms are frequent, monsters and navigational hazards more so.
