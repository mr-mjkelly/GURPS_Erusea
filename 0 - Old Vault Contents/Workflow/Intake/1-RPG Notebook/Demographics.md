## Urban Centers and Villages

The population of an urban center is 1/4 that of the surrounding countryside, which means that for every person in the town or city there are three people within two days ride living in a village, hamlet, or thorp.

Since it takes about 3-5 acres of actively farmed land to support each person, and 1/3 of the total farmland is left fallow, about 4.5 to 7.5 acres of farmland support each person.  ([[Cities|Abrams & Everson, 1981]]) The reciprocal of 4.5 to 7.5 (approximately .222 to .133) is a measurement of the productivity of the land.

A typical village typically comprises 200-300 people. The village farmland supports its own inhabitants and its share (25%) of the urban population, so at the most productive value of 4.5 acres per person, each villager would need to maintain 5.625 acres of land. A village of 200 people would thus maintain about 1,125 acres of farmland; a village of 300 people would maintain 1,687.5 acres of farmland. When least productive, village farmers would be sustaining about 9.375 acres each, or from 1,875 to 2,812.5 acres per village.
### Military Considerations

#### Manors

A good basis for a quasi-medieval military structure is the manor and its lord, the knight. The land held by a night varied a bit, and could realistically be anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 acres. Not all of of this land would be farmed acres, however, as much of it would be forest, bog, rocky terrain, etc. In order to get a sense of what sort of military capacity might be in the vicinity of a town or city, it will be necessary to determine how much of a typical manor is farmland. In the example below, the value is set at 65%. the remaining 35% is the aforementioned "waste" land that is not under till.

If, in this example, a manor is 2,300 acres, only 1,495 acres would be farmland. Assuming an average village size of 250 would need to support 312.5 (250 * 1.25 = 312.5) people with its farmland, and assuming 1 manor per village, 1,495 acres would require a productivity value of 1 / (1,495 / 312.5)  = .209. The size of a manor would vary according to the productivity value. Very productive land, with a productivity of .222, would have 312.5/.222 = 1,406.25 acres of farmland, for a total land allotment of 2,164 acres. Land that is much less productive (productivity .133) would have  312.5/.133 = 2,343.75 acres of farmland, and 3,605.8 acres overall.

In the realm of [[Caredan]], a manor's land potentially supports the following military units:

- 1 heavy horse 
- 2 light horse
-  1 heavy foot
	or
- 2 light foot
	or
- 3 archers

Note that these are levies, and are separate from any urban professional troops and such paid for by the town or by nobles.
