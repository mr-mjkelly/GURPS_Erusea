Some deities are remote beings of inestimable power. Others are closer to the earth, with powers that are limited in some respects. There are also demigods: formal mortals who were elevated to immortal status. The organization and interrelation among these beings is complex. There is a core pantheon of high deities, and a number of cults organized around them. There are no real absolutes with regard to human understanding of the immortal powers. Those with great knowledge have a lot of information about which they more or less agree, and a lot about which they do not. The ordinary people of the world have a multitude of religious understandings. The “barbarians” have a number of deities (or worse) to worship, and some insular island cultures, long forgotten by the inhabitants of the core realms, often have different ways of worshiping the more popular deities. They mix and match pantheons and change the practices and so forth.

Older Humans in Erusea worshipped "elder gods," some of whom may have been kin to, or even the same deities as the elven deities. Some of these deities are not members of any pantheon, and some are not just worshiped by Humans.

Certain immortal beings exist, but are not necessarily deities, even they have great power and maybe even followers.

## The Elanai Pantheon

Aturon - Champion of the Elanai; warrior and hunter.
Dunar - Also known as Dunarin. Lord of the mountains and peaks.
Elanu - King of the Elanai; Lord of the The High Halls.
Eleidwen - Also known as Elaida. Lady of forethought, wisdom, and prophecy.
Evanar
Ilunos - Lord of the Halls of Dreams and a patron of high magic.
Imariel - Queen of the Elanai; Matriarch; goddess of the sky and air (birds).
Kilesti - The wanderer (associated with the evening stars, falling stars, etc. #Question Venus?Luto - Also known as Luatu or Luato. Lord of the seas and waters.

Maielana - Mistress of forests and trees. A deity still worshipped remote reaches of Enyar. 

Maielana, a greater goddess, holds power here, this is her sphere, her hegemony. Little within the forest is evil or poses a great threat to elves and other forest denizens. Several minor powers — lesser deities of local or limited nature — dwell in the forest realm as well. Mortals — dwarves and Men — should tread lightly. Orcs and trolls are virtually doomed. In many respects, elves (and familiar druids) treat goddess and forest as part of one another.

Now consider a remote range of tall mountains, peaks perpetually capped in snow, stone shoulders high above the trees and shrubs. Somewhere in these giants dwells the Smith God, patron of the dwarves. Men also worship him, albeit by other names. Some believe that a road to the halls of other deities, the dwellings of several greater gods and goddesses, is hidden somewhere in these mountains, well secreted and guarded. Great giants (rivals, sometimes enemies of the dwarves) live here, as do some orcs and trolls. In contrast to the nature of Maielana and her forest ... (end). _(from notes c. 2006)_


Osyr - #Question Is this also Osirion?
Silena - Mistress of the Moon.
Tilaris - Mistress of storms and rain.
Turon
Valdur - Also know as Valan — lord of the smiths and smith craft. Possibly known to duergar and dwarves as Jorgrymm. Valdur is not known as a part of the mountains. He took part in their formation, and he is most powerful when based in them, but he has not placed himself in their essence. This is arguably why certain beings not aligned with him (and his dwarven children) still dwell in the range. Valdur is a protector, but not an omniscient or omnipotent one, and he relies more on the hardy dwarves and loyal men to defend his domain.

## Unknown or non-aligned

Anutar - Mother deity, wife of Jovan. Neutral Good.

Arumar - God of war and soldiers. Lawful Neutral.

Jovan - Chief of the pantheon; father/sky god. Lawful Good.

Iarene - Sorceress, moon goddess, seeress (oracular). Chaotic Good.

Khurunor - 

Luhana - Luhana, the Witch Queen is a powerful minor goddess who is present in a very physical form. She dwells in a remote and guarded realm. Because of her physical form, Luhana has many limitations. She cannot be truly present in more than one place at a time, she is vulnerable to physical attacks — very powerful physical attacks — even though she cannot truly be killed. Luhana is a mighty adversary, able to change form and use spells almost without limitation. She commands a number of powerful beings to help her, including much of the Duergar race. _(from notes c. 2006)_

Maedhros - Pronounced ***māth****-rōs*. Lawful Good. A solar/light deity, paternal but somewhat singular (not a member of a pantheon); no feminine counterpart in evidence (although Ishtar and Isis were popular feminine deities in the same regions that Maedhros first held sway). The worship of Maedhros is still a small cult influence in Caredan. Few nobles adhere to his worship (preferring the traditional worship of the Danae). Farther south, in more populated ports and even in larger towns his influence is growing.

Ogromon - 

Orostyr - Wizard, strategist; alchemy. Neutral Good.
