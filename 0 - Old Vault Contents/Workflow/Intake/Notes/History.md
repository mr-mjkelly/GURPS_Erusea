The time before the races can remember (creation)

Mostly origin stories are assigned to this period, with some difficulty establish any sort of timeframe or veracity.

Some disputes among and within pantheons and religions exist.

Elves believe they still dwelt in Faerie, and were not yet divided (sundered) by the toils and turmoil of the “middle world” of mortals.

Few true artifacts originate from this period, although certain more natural or supernatural relics may have.

Some of these relics are evil, and may even have come from Dark Star or one of its attendant bodies.

Certain beings aligned with this evil, and began their efforts to corrupt the world.

Dragons, ancient giants (near demigods in their own right), and other great creatures of land and sea are greater in number and hold more power in this age than the elves and mortal races.

The “first age” in which the gods have some recognizable order, and a loose timeline is widely accepted among sages and scholars

Many Elves leave the Faerie realms and join some of their deities and demigods in the middle world. (Why? Some challenge or enemy? Curiosity?)

It is possible that some of the evil from the preceding era was growing sufficiently strong as to threaten Faerie and other things those deities held dear.

Goblin kind and some giants are a problem.

There are early signs of dwarven works and archaic dwarven runes from this period. Their locations suggest this might have been a period of migration.

Humans are, for the most part, fairly primitive or barbaric, with a few notable exceptions in the warmer southern climes. These are the realms that become the “lost realms” during the Great Devastation, and all but vanish into obscurity.

There are legacies of their passing, however..

Orcs and their kind are secretly bred by dark powers, but are not numerous enough to be noticed by other races.

The coming of Dark Star and the first Great Devastation

An era of woe and war, and immense havoc, the Great Devastation lasts for centuries.

The earth, much changed by the impacts of various asteroids and the subsequent upheaval of land and sea caused by Dark Stars near passing. Even after Dark Star recedes, it takes a long time for the quakes and eruptions to subside.

The evil forces of the world begin to thrive as the Dark Star approaches and its influence on the middle world intensifies, and those beings who dwell beyond the portals to the outer darkness reach forth.

Elves are scattered, and their realms are assaulted by the now numerous orcs and their kin.

The elven deities and many of the demigods retreat from the world; passages to and from Faerie fade, and journeying to and from that realm becomes difficult.

Those elves remaining in the middle world have to remain, gradually succumbing to the forces of time and mortality.

Dwarves retreat to a few separate strongholds and spend centuries in relative isolation, delving deeper into their mountains in search of minerals and metals.

Human realms are shattered, particularly those in the southeastern lands, which are hit directly by shards of the Dark Star and suffer decades of seismic turmoil, vulcanism, and so on.

That particular region of the seas is still considered evil and is avoided by prudent sailors.

A “second age” recovering from the Great Devastation

Few records of the first age survive the devastation. Much of what is known or accepted is collected from the scattered traditional histories of the various peoples.

The second devastation

Time between devastations? This requires some analysis and thinking, but for now peg it at about 2,500 years, give or take.

Not as terrible as the Great Devastation, but still horrible. Its effects last for about a century or so, and the destruction of civilizations and cultures is not as complete.

A great evil is released, however, and there is a great war during and after the devastation to stop it.

Evil is contained, but not eliminated. It lurks, sowing dissent and dismay. Orcs still multiply.

The races are sundered by distrust and strife.

The “third age” recovers from the second Dark Star passing and the following great war.

This is the current age, and the present day for the campaign is late in it (about a century before the next coming of Dark Star, more than 4,000 years after the first devastation epoch).

Much of the division and distrust among the races continues, and evil thrives in the climate of disunity and chaos.
