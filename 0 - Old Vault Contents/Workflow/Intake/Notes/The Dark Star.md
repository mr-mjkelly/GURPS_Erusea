#Question Is the "star" really some other periodic event that occurs in "the heavens," rather than a physical astronomical body?

The Dark Star passes through the stars every 1,100 years. It is normally disruptive, and some say it has passed close enough to cause cataclysms in the ancient past. A few centuries after the war between the [[Ilinarans]] and their Titan enemies a chief [[Titans|Titan]], [[Khurunor]], called upon powers that brought a piece of the Dark Star down upon the heart of the [[Ilinarans|Ilinaran]] realms. The meteor destroyed hundreds of square miles and wreaked havoc. Great earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, and a cloud that darkened the sky for years displaced peoples and creatures as the shorelines, lakes, rivers and mountains heaved and moved. It was nearly a century before the skies cleared, the water stilled, and the land settled firmly.

Wreaks havoc each epoch of its passage.

Interferes with magic, which becomes wilder, less predictable. Latent talent (sorcerers, etc.) is wakened in certain individuals.

Activates or empowers old relics and certain sites.

Interferes with celestial powers and their contact with the world. Deities and their channelers appear to have less power.

Non-celestial powers wax. Ancient powers awaken; seals weaken.
#Question Is this connected to [[Balor]] in some fashion?

Tidal and tectonic forces intensify, become extraordinarily powerful during the final year of the [[The Dark Star|Dark Star’s]] approach and nearest approach.

Dragons breed and stir, as do giants, elementals, and certain other beings.

Prophecies among the religious and superstitious take on meaning; social unrest, war, etc.

Dreamers find it difficult to ignore the forces aligned with the [[The Dark Star|Dark Star]], and some “seers” and “prophets” gain followings.
