## List of Epochs

I don’t want to get bogged down in creating a detailed [[History | history]] of the world in twelve parts, with appendices. What I do want to do is create enough of a historical framework to give the matters of the present a foundation in the past.

Much of the presentation of the ancient times is told from the Ilorian and [[Danar | Danaran]] perspective. This is largely because they have the oldest recorded histories extending back to times before the fall of [[Erion]]. There are other accounts from other perspectives. In some cases those accounts diverge from or directly refute the [[Ilorians|Ilorian]] accounts.

History (that is, the chronicles of the past) is organized into the following major epochs:
### The Dawn of Time

From the [[Ilinar|Ilinaran]] perspective, the story of creation: the origins of the gods and their activities in creating and shaping the world. Pretty vague, and there are other mythologies and cosmologies. Beginnings of the tension between the terrestrial powers (the [[Titans]]) and the celestial powers (the [[Elanai]] and other immortals from beyond the material plane).

This is largely the matter for bards and sages, and perhaps certain priests.
### The Epic Age

The [[Elanai]] establish their realms in the world, challenging the [[Titans]]. Creatures of various sorts begin to choose sides or set themselves apart from the impending strife. The [[Elanai]] share knowledge with various creatures (the first [[Elves]] and, later, the first true men).

Share this as fragmented stories or nuggets of lore research.

**Note:** [[Elves]] and [[Ilinari | Ilinarans]] (including [[Ilorians]]) have different experiences and understandings, and their relationships with the celestial powers differ, but they have much in common even if their particulars differ.
### The Age of Heroes

Great [[Ilinar|Ilinarans]] work against the increasing might and terror of the [[Titans]]. Their lore and power grows, and they are given gifts from the Elanai in order to counter the power of the [[Titan]] overlords. [[Elves]] and men together bring the fight against tyranny to the [[Titans]].

War, which brings about the downfall of the [[Titans]]. The first time the [[The Dark Star|Dark Star]] appears shortly after — summoned by the spiteful [[Titan]] king [[Ogromon]]. An long age of chaos follows as fragments of the [[The Dark Star|Dark Star]] fall from the sky and the world is thrown into physical and metaphysical turmoil.

## List of Ages

### The Age of Myth

The time when the deities and other powers shaped the world. The time, and in some cases the sequence of events is murky in this period, as there was no written history.

The [[Titans]] ruled most of the known and inhabitable world. [[Elves]] are essentially wild folk of forest and hidden valley. [[Dwarves]], [[Gnomes]], and [[Duergar]] are few in number and their involvement in the events of the greater world is not known to the Ilinari, [[Danar]] or other humans, nor to [[Elves]]. Their people maintain their own myths from this period.

The [[Elanai]] were powerful immortals whose realms were to the far west beyond the sea. [[Elanu]] and his kin were said to be reluctant to intervene in matters to the east. Some believed they feared a war with the greatest of the [[Titans]] in the temporal world where there power was limited and they were vulnerable. Others maintained that they were aloof to the plight of mortals. A few have suggested that the restraint was borne of more noble motives and that their ideals supporting free will for thinking beings made them hesitate to show their power. Whatever the case, it was long before they intervened.

It was a younger deity who, while wandering, as the [[Elanai]] sometimes did, the woodlands of the east and visiting with [[Elves]], who sparked the events that led to the lasting war with the mighty [[Giant]] lords. In his travels, he met a band of humans traveling in the forests in hopes of finding a place free from [[Titan]] tyranny, yet still rich for hunting and foraging. They were beset by a force of giants and their lesser, but still formidable, kin, the [[Trolls]].

The _Age of Myth_ ends when the first people become involved, and so begin the _Age of Legends_.

### The Age of Legends

Deities and demi-deities, powerful immortal demons and other beings, great monsters on land and sea. For humans, this is the time before any history, when fireside tales are told of ancient struggles as their race rises from savagery to early civilization. There are many tales, most of unknown provenance; they vary in the telling, and similar tales are told by more than one culture. Artifacts and sites from this age are likewise often of unknown origin or even purpose. The stars of these sagas are often demi-deities or powerful, nearly immortal, beings; humans are not the primary actors for the most part.

### The Age of Heroes

Human heroes ([[Ilinar|Ilinari]]), with help from some other races (particularly gray elves and mountain dwarves) champion their races against the [[Giants]] and [[Trolls|troll-kin]]. In many cases, the songs, lays, sagas, tapestries, etc. are or can be attributed to authors, orators, or artists (some of whom may be of heroic stature themselves). Obviously some great villains, monsters, and items figure prominently in these tales. While immortals and near-immortals were the matter of the age of legend, the age of heroes (more than a millennium after the height of the _Age of Legends_) is primarily the story of mortals of great courage, ability, and renown. By this time, humans have learned various arts, and have skill in magic, the forging of steel (imbued with powers or not), and are organized as tribes or petty kingdoms. The age ends with the establishment of some empires and greater kingdoms. Specifically, the next age, the _Ilinaran Age_, begins with the founding of the first of five kingdoms by the great warlord and [[Ilinar|Ilinaran]] hero, [[Ilor]].

### The Ilinaran Age

Rise of the Ilinaran kingdoms.

### The Age of Strife

War among the [[Ilinar|Ilinari]], and fall of several of the realms to internal strife or outside enemies. Also a period where [[Ilinar|Ilinari]] and other humans became estranged with elves.

### The Danaran High Kingdom

The [[Danar | Danaran]] tribes inherit the territory and the mantle of the [[Ilinar|Ilinaran]] realms and establish a sophisticated realm uniting several [[Kialti]] tribes.

### The Dark Age

Fall of the [[Danar|Danaran High Kingdom]] and a return to petty kings, warlords, tribal strife, etc.

### The Present Age

[[Aldrans]].
