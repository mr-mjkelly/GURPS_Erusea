# The Ancient Age

[[Balor]] and various fell beings from the ruins of [[Fomor]] cross the ice in the far north make landfall. Beginnings of wars with the frost and storm [[Giants]].

As [[Balor|Balor's]] reign grows and [[Giants|giants]] are defeated or retreat north and west, [[Dwarves]] begin to migrate south along the high mountains of the east. Note that [[Dwarves]] and [[Giants]] had a relationship and [[Dwarves]] for long acknowledged the [[Giants|giant]] kind as a sort of mentor and senior race from which they learned much lore and craft. [[Dwarves]] were often subjects to [[Giants|giant]] lords.

Note: [[Fomorians]] (s. _Fomórach_, pl. _Fomóraiġ_) initially fairly powerful beings. Not quite immortal, but more than mere [[Orcs|orcs]], [[Ogres|ogres]], etc. Some are [[giant]]-like, more [[human]] looking, etc. Others are more monstrous. Their “lesser kin” of the later ages are the result of breeding with certain folk of the underground and perhaps others. These are the [[Orcs|orcs]], [[Bugbears|bugbears]], [[Orcs|hobgoblins]], etc.

[[Balor]] attempts to take on the stronghold mountains of the storm [[Giants]] and is defeated, his forces weakened and [[Balor]] himself wounded.

In the forests and valleys, the [[Elves]] become aware of the threat from [[Balor]] and his [[Fomorians]] and begin strengthening the defenses of their lands even as the first skirmishes with creatures. For millennia there is a wary standoff between [[Elves]] and the [[Fomorians]], but the latter are multiplying and gradually expanding.

Over nearly a millennium, Humans begin exploring the lands.

They explore in the northeast, some actually settling along the shores there and establishing fishing and hunting villages and ports. Some of these humans move inland and even become subjects of the [[Maghwen|Ice Witch]] (also known as [[Maghwen]]).
