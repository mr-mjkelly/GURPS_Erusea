Note: Fomorians (s. _Fomórach_, pl. _Fomóraiġ_) are initially fairly powerful beings. Not quite immortal, but more than mere [[Orcs|orcs]], [[Ogres|ogres]], etc. Some are [[Giants|giant]]-like, more [[Humans|human]] looking, etc. Others are more monstrous. Their “lesser kin” of the later ages are the result of breeding with certain folk of the underground and perhaps others. These are the [[Orcs|orcs]], [[Bugbears|bugbears]], [[Hobgoblins|hobgoblins]], etc. I am not decided whether [[Goblins|goblins]] are an older race in their own right.
