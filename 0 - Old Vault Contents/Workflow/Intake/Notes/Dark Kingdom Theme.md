(well, Kingdoms…)

-   Don’t lose track of the fact that the current age is a dark age. [[Ilinar]] is a myth to those currently living (well, most of them…). Even sages have only scant information regarding that age. Barbarian realms, scattered and relatively minor in size and power, are de rigueur. Petty realms have cropped up in places. Savage races — [[Giants]], [[Trolls]], [[Orcs]] — menace the lands again.

-   Across the seas, matters are worse. Humankind — at least those realms known to the [[Aldrans]], [[Kialti]], [[Danar]], [[Escendi]], etc., are clinging to the coasts and isles of the southern continent. The inner lands are wild, inhabited by strange and terrible beasts and rumored to hide remnants of formerly mighty realms.

-   The Great Desert is in a similar state.
    -   Small realms mostly, loosely central but with strong lords and lots of ungoverned land.

-   War — and internal squabbling — is common.

-   In the north and west, Kialti realms have formed in the century or more since the fall of a high kingdom.
    -   Some of the lords of these realms are more civilized than their clannish neighbors.
    -   Druids and bards are an influence across tribal boundaries, holding a cultural, spiritual and legal tradition that acts as a common characteristic of the [[Kialti]] people in these realms.
-   Midlands and some eastern coast lands — [[Aldrans|Aldran]] people, ruled by  and titled lords (early pre-feudalist form of government).
    -   Religions (more than one) are organized around chapels, temples, and orders of monks and priests. Knighthood of a sort is established around fighting orders — mercenary or affiliated with a cause or patron.
    -   Landed nobility and soldiers also (castles, keeps, and other strongholds).
-   Southern coast, peninsula, isles — a sort of high kingdom or empire (in the style of the Carolingian Empire)
    -   Strong church ([[Karos 1|Karosian]]), complex economy (overseas trade, credit, etc.), intrigues, guilds, foreigners. Early feudal government — strong and often wealthy merchant families (noble or otherwise).

-   [[Dragons]] — great and small

-   Deities — nature, role in campaign
    -   Lesser immortals (demi-gods, great [[Giants]])

-   Some names on the page: [[Bregaldi]], [[Aelsh]], [[Escendi]]

-   Is [[Taranor]] an ancient and legendary realm/city-state?

-   Possible continent names: [[Alusian]] continent, [[Erusea|Erusean]] continent, [[Thunar]] (frozen waste sub-continent).

-   [[Iskarthus]] — an ancient [[Sorcerer]]/[[Wizard]] (necromancer)
    -   defeated about two centuries before campaign present
    -   Somewhat responsible for fall of [[Kialti]] high kingdom

-   [[Cuinar Iluth]] — a contemporary sorcerer trying to reclaim some of [[Iskarthus|Iskarthus']] power and knowledge.

-   [[Krushak]] — a powerful [[Half-orcs]] warlord.
