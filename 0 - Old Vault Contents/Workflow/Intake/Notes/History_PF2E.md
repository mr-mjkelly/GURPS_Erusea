# Current History

## Things to consider

- The purpose of a campaign milieu history is to provide background foundation.
- It will never be complete. Even Tolkien never "finished" the whole history of everything in Middle-Earth
- There is no absolute historical authority or reference. Like real history, scholars do their best to learn from the past, but not all agree or accept others' versions of historic or prehistoric events.
	- That said, some sort of authoritative frame of reference is necessary. This is a design necessity as well as an in-milieu one. As a GM, I need to have a narrator for the sourcebook lore available to the world's inhabitants. Those inhabitants need a central frame of reference, or perhaps a few frames of reference, in order to form civilizations. Even those who would not accept much of any central paradigm need to have a point from which to deviate.
	- History is tied up in mythology and religion, and also legend (including regional and local). So, another source of variation and points of debate, dispute, and even conflict.
- Much of the milieu history will be captured in the background for creatures, places, cultures, realms, adventure locations, artifacts, etc.
## The Epochs, broadly

### Creation (Age of Myth)

- No measurable time
### Prehistory (Age of Legends)
- The Dominion of the Giants
	- [[Titans]]
		- Cyclopes
			- [[Balor_PF2E]]
	- [[JÃ¶tnar]]
	- [[Lesser Giants]]
	- [[Ogres]]
	- [[Trolls]]
	- Events
		- [[Titans]] were among the first beings in the world, and at first attended the [[Deities and Pantheons|gods]] and created a great civilization. As their lore and power grew, they came to resent and envy the [[Deities and Pantheons|gods]]. At some point, they attempted to usurp power from the [[Deities and Pantheons|gods]], then rebelled openly, starting a great war. The [[Deities and Pantheons|gods]] win, more or less, although much of their work is ruined or altered, and the elder [[Deities and Pantheons|gods]] withdraw from the world, or retreat to enclaves and redoubts. Many of those who sided with the [[Titans]] survived in a fairly primitive state as the ancient civilization collapsed.
			- [[Balor_PF2E]] is among the most ambitious of the survivors, and figures strongly in the next age.
		- 
### Early History
- A key element to this epoch is that it is based largely on written accounts, or at least strong and formal oral tradition (skalds, bards).
- Also, time begins to be measured more deliberately.

# History from earlier efforts

### Humans

- Over nearly a millennium, humans begin exploring the lands.
    - It is possible they learned of these lands from [[Sea Elves]].

- They explore in the northeast, some actually settling along the shores there and establishing fishing and  hunting villages and ports. Some of these humans move inland and even become subjects of the [[Maghwen|Ice Witch]] (villages and ports. Some of these humans move inland and even become subjects of the [[Maghwen|Ice Witch]] (also known also known as [[Maghwen]]).
