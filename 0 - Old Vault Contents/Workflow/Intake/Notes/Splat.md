# Loose design ideas

- History is often a rabbit hole for my design efforts.
	- The key is to avoid attempting to build a complete history along the scale of Tolkien's Middle-Earth.
	- Keep history close to the living campaign and use it to ground those elements of the milieu encountered by PCs.
	- Keep history notes for ideas that occur and work them into the wider history as appropriate.
	- Always keep in mind that history is in the mind of the beholder: different races, cultures, and individuals will have different understandings of history along with their religious and socio-political paradigms.
- Use history to:
	- Establish the start of the campaign (base town, early adventures, and characters)
		- Character (PC and NPC) backgrounds require at least a recent historical context.
	- Establish origins, or at least plausible origins from inhabitants' perspectives, for creatures, ruins, items, conflicts, etc.
- I am going to try a hybrid design approach. I want to focus on a walled base town on a river and its immediate area. The PCs can adventure locally and gradually expand their range and the nature of their encounters.
## The Wider World

- The ancient realm of the [[Ilinarans]] gives way to the [[Danaran High Kingdom]] which, in time, falls on hard times and collapses into a smaller but ancient and significant realm ([[Taranor]], etc.).
	- [[Ilinarans]] came from "across the sea" and were a sophisticated civilization for more than a millennium prior to their arrival. Their religion, lore, magic, etc. are literally the stuff of legend.
- As the [[Ilinarans]] waned, and mingled with the more sophisticated proto-[[Kialti]] tribes (primarily, the [[Danar]]), they lost some of their longevity, magical talent, and lore.

# Questions and Considerations

- Is [[Mileu Name]] a planet, a past epoch on Earth, or an alternative reality?
	- Answer: At this point, I am not going to specify. There are, of course, humans, and horses, and so forth, so an argument could be made that this is Earth or an alternative reality. If one assumes that humans (and horses) are not necessarily identical to those on Earth (or are, but for reasons not yet revealed)
- How did the current cultures establish themselves?
- Are there deities?
	- Are the deities real?
	- Are they abstract or remote, or actively in the milieu?
- What is the ethos for the overall milieu?
	- Are "good" and "evil" absolutes and part of the nature of the cosmology?
	- Are the qualities of "order" and "chaos" (i.e., the "alignments" inspired by Dungeons & Dragons) a factor?
	- Does the ethos affect things like magic, places, items.

- Initially, I intend for this to be a Pathfinder 2e campaign. I am interested in GURPS, but not committed to it as the best system for this next FRPG campaign.

# Thematic Elements

- Keep a lid on magic use and spellcasting for world balance as well as part of a theme. Magic in the milieu should be consequential, and the consequences grow in significance with the power of the spells.
- The initial setting will be in a temperate, primarily "continental" climate. I still need to workout the geography.
	- The settled humans are agrarian and tend toward small monarchies. In recent centuries, two or three realms have become larger states and at least one is expanding east and north into the wilder regions of the "lost realms."
