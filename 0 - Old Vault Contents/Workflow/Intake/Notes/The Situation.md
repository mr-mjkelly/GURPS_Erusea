It's a [[B2_The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands.pdf|Keep on the Borderlands]] thing.
- There is a kingdom.
    - It's fairly small, like a Welsh Briton-type kingdom like Dyfed or Gwynedd.
    - There are legends, references of an older high kingdom, but little political evidence of it other than druidic/bardic law.
    - The "keep" is the base town, and is the core base town from which travel to other base towns, villages, monasteries, etc.
    - Across the river from the keep is wild and lawless land.
        - It was once part of some older, larger realm.
- "Wild Elves" dwell in the great forest.
- Dwarves hold mines and other redoubts in the stony mountains.
	- Dwarves are regarded as strange in many ways, but are generally trusted traders, crafters, and builders. Although they are wealthy and known for having great stores of wealth in gold, silver, platinum, gems and the like, they are not money lenders (dwarves disapprove of usury and thus find no value in loaning as a means of increasing their wealth).
- Elves (other than Wild Elves) still dwell on the keep side of the river, near but still apart from and often secluded, if not actually concealed and magically veiled. Their settlements are not large, or are their numbers great. These elves are not associated with the High Elves of the north, but are nevertheless more civilized and settled than their wilder woodland cousins across the river.
	- Elves and humans are somewhat estranged since before the fall of the human High Kingdom; many humans have long forgotten why, but the estrangement has given way to alienation in more populous and settled human regions, and elves are not always welcome or treated in friendly ways.
- Keep in mind to treat this as a fragmented culture, not a united realm. Rival lords, petty kings on the far side of the river, strange rulers of small fiefdoms dwell in semi-ruins and so on. Little is known, even by sages, of what lurks in dark recesses.

## Adventuring

### The near side of the river

- There are some ruins to explore.
- Goblins,and similar monsters,  in small numbers, still pose a threat or at least a nuisance to civilized settlements.

### The far side of the river

- The wild elves are not evil, but can be hostile to intrusion or even to passage through the region.
- There are significant ruins, and attendant monsters of greater might, in the remnants of the old high kingdom.
- Various legacies from the past: evil sorcerers and wizards, warlords, orcs and half-orcs, petty kings/queens, etc.
