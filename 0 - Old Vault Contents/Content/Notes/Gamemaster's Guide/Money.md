GURPS assumes a pound of silver is $1,000. This is historically nearly correct. I made some notes below based on some medieval coins in England, enough to provide a decent mix.

| GURPS | Aldran |
| :---: | :---: |
| $1 | 1 farthing (bronze) |
| $4 | 1 d. (silver) 4 Farthings
| $2|  1 d. 2 Half pence (bronze) |
| $24 |  6 d. 1 Sixpence (silver) |
| $48 |  12 d. 1 Shilling (s.) |
| $240|  60 d. 1 Crown |
| $480 | 120 d. 1 Half Sovereign (gold) |
| $640 | 160 d. 1 Mark (silver) |
| $960 | 240 d. 1 Sovereign (gold) |
| $960 | 240 d. 1 Pound (l.) |

I am considering what sort of currency I want in this campaign. On the one hand, I want to ditch the generic, gamey "gold piece, silver piece, copper piece" nomenclature. On the other hand, I do not want an overly complex system to use in play, nor one requiring me to overhaul the prices in the official references.

This RPG Stack Exchange post below mentions that the Dungeons & Dragons tradition was for a gold piece (g.p.) to be roughly an 11th century shilling, which was 12d (pence).

[How much is a Gold Piece really worth?](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/61840/how-much-is-a-gold-piece-really-worth)

It may be best to leave the relative ratios of coins as written and simply pay for most goods and services with silver rather than gold. Ten silver pennies per gold piece is close enough for fit and feel. The slight change is to consider silver and copper to be the primary coinage in Caredan, and thus make gold pieces and other forms of gold notable exceptions. Accepted in most cases, but definitely something that merchants, innkeeps and tavern wenches, etc. will remember, and others might find worth some inquiry. Information about older minted currency, such as might come from treasure hordes and the like, or currency from other realms (especially gold coins and bars) will almost certainly cause a raised eyebrow among the ruling class.

Copper pieces (c.p.) are a bit low, I think, but I can live with them. 10 c.p. for each silver piece is doable.

#Question Should I name the coins?
#Question Gold pieces are the equivalent of a shilling (in this case, 10 s.p.). Should I create any higher denominations? Like a "crown" (say 20 shillings) (200 s.p., which is sort of close to 240 s.p.)
