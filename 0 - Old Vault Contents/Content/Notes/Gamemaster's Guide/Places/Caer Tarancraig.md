alias: Tarancraig, Tarancraig Keep
---

_taranu_ means "thunder"
_craig_ means "rock"
_ogof_ means den, grotto, cavern

The keep is high on a high, steep promontory overlooking a wide and deep part of a fast river, about a half mile upstream of some significant falls. The keep is the seat of the lord of [[Penarth Taranu]] as well as the primary watch over the lands across the river. The "thunder" (*taranu* Welsh) of the upper of two falls is quite prominent in the immediate vicinity.

It is a well known secret that there are caves beneath the upper falls. Lesser known is that there are secret ways from the basement vaults of the keep into a cavern complex with connections to secret exits in and near the falls, and perhaps in other places as well. The keep is old, and the old keep was built on the site of still older foundations.

Several villages and various freehold farms can be reached in a day or two by road. There are one or two towns two to three days away (these would have castles).

There is a chapel in the keep itself, and a temple in the adjacent walled town. A few shrines and holy sites are located in the surrounding countryside. Druids (along with other clerics, bards, a ranger or two, and some fighters) maintain a grove in a nearby wooded vale. There is a monastery/temple complex and supporting village two or three days away.

There is a fortified ford beneath the second of the two great waterfalls; between the two falls is a keep that guards a collapsed and ruined bridge. The keep on the near side of the river is manned by some guards, but the corresponding keep on the far side is in ruins and is not.
