Riverthorn keep is in a place that has an old druid grove that is warded in part by a magically enhanced ring of thorn hedges. A group of druids, priests and priestesses, and some bards tend to and guard the place. There are perhaps some rangers or other warriors dedicated to the grove and shrine within.

Currently Aldrans hold the keep, but the castellan-marshal, appointed by the king of Arudan, is on good terms with many of the local Kialti lords, and has diplomatic and trade relations with Danarans, some of the more friendly and civil Aelsh tribes, [[Elves|elves]] and dwarves, and even Iskendi traders who come up river in the warm spring trade season. In the town below the keep many different people from among these groups have been known to frequent the taverns, inn, and marketplace.

There are two bridges: Highthorn, a cover, wooden upstream bridge spanning high above the rapid flow below; and the Rose Bridge, which is the main bridge, built of strong stone and guarded by strong gatehouses at either end.

##### The wider world

Riverthorn is a base town on the borderland marches of a quasi-medieval human realm, Arudan. The region is called Aragal, and it is not very populous. Riverthorn is a castle town, built nearly a century ago by an Aldran lord who was granted a crennelation charter by the king of Ardain. Across the river is the frontier, a wild land of lost realms, the lands and abodes of demi-human and non-human races, and the haunts of dangerous and malevolent creatures.

Loosely, the history of the realm includes a pre-human elder age. Elves and dwarves, goblin kind, giants, dragons, etc. had millennia of time before the first humans arrived from across the seas and over the high mountains to the far west.

The first humans were primitive and nomadic hunter gatherers. Some of these first people befriended the valley elves, and a few even got along with the wood elves. Later migrations of men were the first to work in iron, and build with wood and stone. Some of these were the ancestors of the Aelsh and Kialti, and of the wise and powerful Danar.

Centuries later, raiders from across the eastern seas plundered the shores and made forays up rivers. The foremost of these were the Kalutes in the cold and barren north, and the Iskendi, who eventually settled along the rugged wooded shores to the east.

In the last few centuries, bands of humans from across the southern seas began arriving, first as traders, then as settlers and colonists, and, for nearly two centuries, as migrant invaders. Well armed and with sophisticated organization and military capability, the Aldrans, as they named themselves, have established strong fedual kingdoms and are continuing to spread north and west.

Riverthorn is positioned to be a "keep on the borderlands," as it were, only a much richer and more detailed one than the original concept.

I envision the current keep to be an expansion and renovation of a much older keep originally built by the Danarans during a period when their High Kingdom extended its power this far south and east. This means that there are secrets and wonders that the new Aldran occupants don't know...

##### Population

The marchlands of Aragal have a human population of around 300,000. The population density is around 37 people per square mile, assuming that the whole region is just over 8,000 square miles. Only about 6% of the land is arable, although there is land for grazing cattle and sheep which helps to compensate, so about 31% of the land, or nearly 2,500 sq. miles, is under cultivation or, more likely, dedicated to sheep or cattle. In all, that amount barely supports the human population in the region, even allowing for some food from other sources, such as commerce, fishing, hunting, etc.

There are few large towns in the marches, and only one is as large as 5,000 people. Riverthorn's population is around 2,000 people. The town's own lands, and the seven or eight surrounding villages within a day's ride, provide most of the support. Other supplies and logistics come via the river in trade, or overland from Arudan.
