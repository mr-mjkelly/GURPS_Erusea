## General Population

Some basic assumptions

The land area comprising Arudan is around 60,000 square miles. The overall population density is 45 people per square mile, leading to a base population of 2,700,000 people.

An acre of land can support 180 people, and this means that 15,000 square miles of the land is agricultural., or 25% of the available land. With two major cities (pop. 24,648 and 7,394, respectively) and four towns (pop, 6,809, 3,819, 4,259, and 3,368), 526 square miles of land is urban (.88% of the total land area). That leaves 44,474 square miles (74.12%) of the land as forest, water, rocky, etc.

The realm has around 270 nobles or ranking clergy (barons, sherrifs, dukes, abbots, bishops, archbishops, etc.), and can support about 1,350 landed knights. Note that there are about 8,000 1,200 acre "knight's fees" in the realm (the minimum land required to support a fully equipped equestrian warrior). Some landed knights might have more than one such fee and would thus be wealthier than those with only one. Fees not held by knights are consumed by the demesne holdings of the higher nobility and clergy.

Inhabitants of the land within Arudan's border have been building forts for 2,500 years. This indicates there are reasonably 27 significant ruins in the realm. Based on the population, there are also about 54 active castles.
