The five cities. [[Erion]], with her seven towers; [[Parnos]] the port city, whose walls were unassailable and whose merchants could weigh the holds of ships on the far horizon; [[Charion]], city of temples, where bards play their lyres at the feet of the gods; [[Ilyos]], high in the mountains, where seers and mystics dream of matters beyond mortal sight; (name?], hall of the twelve Kings...

## The Cataclysm and the Collapse of the [[Ilyan]] Civilization

The destructive epoch often alluded to in the legends of many cultures is typically cast in terms of immortal struggles among Powertul deities and great heroes, and usually depicts some port of the fall of the llyan realms in an upheaval of land and sea. It is evident that a period of volcanism and seismic catastrophe did lead to the downfall of [[Ilyos]] And her sister realms, but it is important to realize that the period of upheaval was nearly a century long, reckoned from the first quakes, tsunami, and volcanic eruptions that harbingered the doom of the realms. It is also important to understand that the society of the [[Ilyan]] realms was in decline, having spent a couple of centuries in decadence and imperialism. Outwardly strong, the [[llyan|Ilyan Empire]] was rotting from within. Perhaps, as the legends recount, their downfall was the will of the gods.

## Atulan

* from old notes in a paper notebook, date indeterminate

#### Atulan

-   Subcontinent settled by [[Ilor]] and his people.
    
    -   Other folk dwelt there, but migration was peaceful.
        
    -   [[Ilor]] and people — an exodus from some event or situation (dark gods, strife...) in lands south and west.
        
    -   [[Tuanar|Tuanan]] people (of goddess [[Tuana]], a mother goddess of triune nature, where sons of sky, sun, and earth were guardians of the land) granted [[Ilor]] and his people leave to dwell in a certain area of land as long as they respected Tuana and her children and people, priests, temples, and made sacrifices of gratitude (tribute, animals) on the anniversary of their arrival.
        
-   [[Ilorians]] bad their own beliefs in the pantheon of [[Elanu]] ([[Elanai|Elanai]]), whose realm was the [[The High Halls|High Halls]], and whose peers were many.
    
    -   Religion was sophisticated, formed, and practitioners were priests, seers, astrologers — strictly governed by temple orders, authority.
        
    -   [[Tuanar|Tuanan]] people were more pastoral, and their temples were tended by local devotees, oracles, prophets without central authority.
        
        -   Culture clash.
            
-   More industrious and energetic, and better organized tor large government writing, bureaucracy, etc), the [[Ilorians]] built great cities in their lands, a few of which were ports. They built roads, aqueducts, bridges, monuments, temples, and shrines. From trade, they gained wealth, which they used to pay [[Tuanar|Tuanans]] to work their lands, crew their ships, maintain their structures, and even serve in the army and navy. Cities became great city-states, city-states oversaw large regions, overseas colonies, etc.
    
-   As the [[llorians]] grew in power and wealth, they grew confident enough to wage war on, and defeat, their enemies to the south and west. This increased their power and control of the sea- and of territories on two continents shores.
    
    -   Trading partners on northern continent included [[Dwarves|dwarves]] and [[Elves|elves]].
        
    -   Expansion of colonies also made enemies — [[Giants]], some barbarians — sea and land. At height of power, a nuisance, but sowed seeds for later problems.
        
-   With power came pride, and from wealth grew greed. [[llorians|Ilorian]] arrogance led, some argue, to overreach, and the city-states grew increasingly competitive. Occasionally, city-states fought one another, although such quarrels were usually short, with peace adjudicated by the religions orders.
    
-   At some point, an [[llorians|Ilorian]] scion decided to establish a city in a region of [[Atulan]] not ceded to the [[Ilorians]] by the [[Tuanar|Tuanans]]. This scion, who married into [[Tuanar|Tuanan]] nobility, asserted that his claim was justified by his ties to [[Tuanar|Tuanan]] bloodlines. The city was built, but so was a temple to [[Tuana]], and so were statues and shrines to her children. This epoch passed without consequence, and the sixth [[Ilorians|Ilorian]] city-state was born.
    
-   It was the newfound religion from the distant east that doomed [[Atulan]]. [[Minor]], an eastern deity of virility masculine might, grew popular with soldiers, both [[Tuanar|Tuanan]] and [[Ilorians|Ilorian]], and later gained following among the lower and even middle classes.
    
    -   Both [[Tuanar|Tuanan]] and [[Ilorians|Ilorian]] religious leaders resisted this alien deity, but the "bull god" appealed to the less wealthy, Particularly in and near the cities, His temples sprouted in hiding, his emblems appeared in markets and public places. In colonies, his worship was more openly practiced. [[Minor]] was not an evil god, And many of his virtues were admirable — but his influence was a challenge.
        
    -   It led to an uprising. In several of the colonies of one city-state, [[Ilorians|Ilorian]] priests had temple guards, augmented by city-state troops, destroy a [[Minor|Minoran]] temple and kill or detain several of its followers. As news and rhetorical exaggeration spread, unrest in the city-state itself flamed into revolt.
        
    -   During the revolt, temples were desecrated — and the new temple to [[Tuana]], along with the statues of her sons — were razed. It was an affront to those gods, and disaster followed shortly.
        
        -   An astronomical event (omens), falling stars
            
        -   Various portents — oracular visions, doomsayers
            
        -   Earthquakes and a large comet becomes visible to the naked eye
            
        -   Meteor showers weeks before a huge strike to the east — sympathetic quakes, tsunami, massive volcanic eruptions destroy [[Atulan]]
            
    -   Certain people escape, and certain colonies are inland enough to have escaped devastation.
        
        -   One colony in particular — [[llinar]] — grows to become a city-state
            
    -   As [[llinar]] grows, other people in the region also develop and interact with the Ilinarans.
        
        -   The [[Caldyrni]] — including the [[Kialti]], [[Danar]], and [[Aelsh|Aelsh]] — later migrants after cataclysm
            
        -   Native (aboriginal) [[Daiar Atani]]
            
        -   [[Dwarves]] (migrants after cataclysm)
            
        -   [[Elves]]
            
        -   [[Giants]], [[Trolls]], [[Orcs]]
            
-   Not a bad mythological "history” but needs some more supernatural elements.
    
    -   Monsters — including [[Gryphons]] and [[Pegasi]]. flying mounts.
        
    -   Consider [[Atulan|Atulan's]] ecology — special and ordinary creatures
        
    -   Local, relatively quiet old dragons — symbols, protected. Not “good” as such, but not as malevolent as some.
        
    -   [[Tuana]] and sons guarded land against many enemies
        
        -   Northern [[Giants]]
            
            -   Otherworldly realm of some greadt giants (storm, frost)
                
            -   Lesser [[Giants]] and [[Trolls]]
                
-   The story of the north is somewhat separate trom that of [[Atulan]] until [[Ilorians|Ilorian]] colonization. By that colonial period, [[Elves]] and some [[Dwarves]] were well established, dealing in their own way with [[Giants]], [[Trolls]], etc. Barbarian men have settled in some regions.
    
-   [[Caldyrni]] and [[Vanur]] migrations occur centuries before significant [[Ilorians|Ilorian]] colonization, [[Caldyrni]] tribes well established before a permanent [[Ilorians|Ilorian]] colony takes root, [[Vanur]] become both land and sea-raiders.
    
-   The [[Caldyrni]] and [[Vanuran]] pantheons are different from the [[Ilorians]], the [[Tuanar]], and from each other. Both, however, incorporated nearly immortal heroes — often presented as either descendants from or blessed by one or more deities — in their beliefs, These heroes were founders of tribes, patrons of certain classes of regions, of — in some cases — aloof champions.
    
    -   Note that this differs from the theistic approach of the [[Ilorians]], who did not believe deities consorted with mortals, [[Of Deities and Cosmology|Deities]] properly worked through intermediaries (priests, oracles, seers, prophets, etc.)
        
    -   [[Caldyrni]] and [[Vanuran]] religion, while less pastoral than the [[Tuanar|Tuanan]] approach, is still closer to its adherents and less systematic and organized than the [[Ilorians|Ilorian]] religion.
        
-   [[Rian]], [[Turion]], [[Taran]] — founding heroes (and heroine)
    
    -   [[Turion]] and [[Rian]] were early, [[Taran]] was a later figure (the next generation or so). [[Caldyrni]] royalty descend trom these three.
        
    -   [[Taran]] is among the of the [[Danar]] to welcome the refugees from [[Atulan]], help them found the city-state of [[Ilinar]], and then again (after marrying an llorian princess...), helps them when [[Ilinar]] itself falls.
        
-   Thematic note: [[Elanai|Elanai]] pantheon appears more remote than [[Tuanar]], or the deities of the [[Vanur]] and [[Caldyrni]].
    
    -   Celestial deities arguably work less directly and need more worshipers, loci, etc. to maintain contact (actual embodiment or other manifestation is very taxing).
        
    -   As the [[llorians]] waned, and the priests, temples decreased, the [[Elanai|Elanai]] bad fewer followers and less influence.
        
    -   The question is, do they actually have less power, or just less involvement? Can they exert their will from the celestial abodes, This is the hope of those few who still revere them. #Question 
        

Consider the [[Caldyrni]] immigrants to be the first serious human challenge to the great [[Giants|giants]] and [[Trolls|trolls]]. [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] managed to reckon with their enemies enough to defend their realms. For their part, the [[Vanur]], championed by some of their heroes, established themselves as a force with which to be reckoned. However, it was the [[Caldyrni]], with heroes, sages, mages, and a genius for military action, who proved a persistent thorn in the sides of [[Giant|giant]] and [[Orcs|orc]] kind.
