A walled town, population 1,200


The land surrounding the town is fairly productive, requiring about 4 acres be actively farmed per person. Based on the information in the [[Demographics]] note, that means that each person requires 6 acres of farmland, since 1/3 of land is left fallow (productivity .1667). There are  11 or 12 villages near Aronel, with an average population of just over 257 and 1,543 acres of farmland. The total farmland is 21,600 acres (33.75 square miles).

In the area of Aronel, a typical manor's farmland is 312.5 / .1667 = 1,875 acres. Manors usually farm around 65% of the land, so the total land governed by the average manor lord is 2,884.6 acres. This means that Aronel's surrounding villages could support 11-12 knights and associated military: 22-24 light horse, as well as 11-12 heavy foot or 22-24 light foot or 33-36 archers.

Note that the total governed land (by humans...) is around 31,731 to 34,615 acres, or 50 to 54 square miles.

Scenarios

- Notes
	- Don't over plot the adventure!
		- Set up the scenario, characters, along with character and location background info.
		- Set up encounters as opportunities for PCs to learn facts (and non-facts...) about the situation and make their own decisions.
			- PCs may not care at all about the plight of a merchant guildmaster or his son, and instead will want to pursue the brigands in search of adventure and treasure (and perhaps remuneration), or deal with [[Goruk the Goblin Shaman|Goruk]] and other [[Goblins|goblins]] in a fashion less diplomatic than confrontational.
