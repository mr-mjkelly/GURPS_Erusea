The “first people” of the land are Bronze Age people who dwell primarily in the woodlands and hills to the west of the Haldran Mountains in western Haldrun. They are reclusive folk, although they are fairly familiar and friendly with [[Elves|elves]] and halflings, and sometimes trade with dwarves who have won their trust. Relatively small in stature and lithesome, the Daiar Atani (often simply called Atani, singular Atanu) are exceptional hunters and trackers. Their aim with darts, short bows, slings, and spears is fearsome. Although they are very attuned and empathetic to natural creatures, the Atani do not ride animals. As healers and practitioners of natural medicine, few possess more lore than the Daiar Atani, who are spiritually animistic and worship natural spirits and the general essence of wild nature.
