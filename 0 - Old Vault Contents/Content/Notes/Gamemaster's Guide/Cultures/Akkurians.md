The Akkurians are a tough people, they are a warrior culture (even the women are trained defensive fighters) with a strict class structure. Akkurian warriors are extremely well trained masters of the martial arts — particularly the sword, axe, pole arm, and heavy crossbow. Because of drakes and other dangerous denizens of the mountain regions, Akkurians have need of a weapons as well as their heavy katana-like swords, which are their traditional weapons of battle against fellow men.

Akkurians dwell in lofty mountain city-states, walled strongholds that are typically built into the living rock of mountainsides or valley walls. These forts normally hold more than one Akkurian “house; and each house has representatives on a ruling council, which in turn appoints the captains and lords of the strongholds. Since these great keeps are so tar removed from the agricultural resources of the lower volleys and gentler hillsides, there are networks of lesser strongholds from which warriors can patrol and guard the farms and hunting territories. Serfs and slaves, the conquered and captured from other realms, do the actual farming and other stoop labor. While the Akkurian masters are not cruel, they are strict masters as well as faithful protectors.

Valladium (Irskadium?) is a metal that only the Akkurians know how to create and work into tools, weapons, and armor — such as the Chobrak lance (a barbed lance with harpoon-like characteristics). Only gifted Akkurians — lords, heroes, anf lucky adventurers — will have significant Valladium possessions. It would be very extraordinary for any other culture to possess Valladium wares.

I am currently imagining Akkuria as a land fairly ringed with mountainous, craggy terrain, but with access to an inner region (complete with a great river, lakes, etc. — very exotic) that acts as its spiritual (mystical) heartland. The outer Akkurians guard this region, which may contain another culture that they regard as oracular and mystical people blessed by the remote gods.

Akkurian religion is somewhat nihilistic. The few Akkurian gods are not high powers in control of creation, but powerful immortal beings who were benefactors to the prototypical ancestors (one of whom may jave been a betrayer). Those ancestors also figure strongly in the Akkurian beliefs, which tend to be fatalistic in outlook and have no concept of an eterndd afterlife, The women worship certain specific ancestors, and have a belief in a matron goddess of hearth and home (not a universally powerful mother goddess, but one with similar attributes). A special caste of magicians and clerics control both the ritual of religion and such magic as the Akkurians use, except the alchemical craft of working in Valladium, which is controlled by a small group of elite smiths. The magic caste is open to men and women, most of the Akkurian society is wary of their power, particularly the warlord aristocracy.
