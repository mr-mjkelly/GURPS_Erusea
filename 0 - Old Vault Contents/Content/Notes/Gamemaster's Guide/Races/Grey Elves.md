The grey [[Elves|elves]] dwell in many places in Erusea, and perhaps some dwell in far off lands. Like their close kin, the [[Sea Elves|sea elves]], gray [[Elves|elves]] even live and work among humans and dwarves, and there are occasionally romantic relations between gray [[Elves|elves]] and humans.

Gray [[Elves|elves]] live in a variety of places, in family groups, clans, or even realms. Some gray [[Elves|elves]] are great lords (or even kings, in the style of humans). However, gray [[Elves|elves]] have also been known to live in small homesteads, remote woodland or valley settings, ancient places of beauty and significance, and so on. Some live among humans, although few would live for long in large human settlements such as walled towns and cities. It is also not uncommon for gray [[Elves|elves]] to wander, travel, and adventure with other races.

One of the oldest and best known alliances of [[Elves|elves]] and men lives on in the various [[Ranger Companies|ranger companies]] who keep watch on the borders of [[Danar]].

Gray [[Elves|elves]] live 350-500 years.
