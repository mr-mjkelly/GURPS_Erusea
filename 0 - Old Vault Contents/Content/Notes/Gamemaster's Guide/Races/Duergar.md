**_Dvargi_**

A dark, furtive people who live in, and reputedly deep beneath, the mountains far to the north of the great lakes, the [[Duergar|duergar]] are extremely territorial and xenophobic. Many of them are loyal or on good terms with the Witch Queen and her folk, and guard the trade routes from her realm to the forests of the eastern shores. They have some trade relations with the Aelsh and Kalutes, but are not friendly with either. Duergar are known to be talented and powerful with magic.

Also known as *dvargi*, [[Duergar|duergar]] are a subterranean people who live deep under the cold, stony mountains of northeastern Erudan. They seldom leave their underground domain and rarely spend any time on the surface, particularly during daylight. Duergar are xenophobic and hostile to intruders with few exceptions. Clan rivalries and feuds often escalate to wars that can last for generations. Duergar do trade with some outsiders, and one exception to their xenophobia is that they get along well with some giants, who act as their liaisons to other races and help them with trade and occasional diplomatic situations.

Physically, Duergar are more compact than stocky. They live an average of 450 years, reaching adulthood at age 50.
