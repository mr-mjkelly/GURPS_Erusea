Goblins often live near human settlements. Humans, unlike [[Elves|elves]] and [[Dwarves|dwarves]], tend to tolerate goblins at a reasonable distance. While [[Elves|elves]] cannot abide goblins' offensive and odious ways, and [[Dwarves|dwarves]] despise their seemingly lawless and chaotic tendencies toward mischief, humans view them as more of a curious background nuisance of no particular concern. Goblins are rarely enough of a threat or problem to warrant serious action.

## Ideas about goblins

- I am, of course, not inclined to accept the Paizo stock RAW goblin in my milieu. I am imagining a less ridiculous creature, with more fay attributes and a less frivolous appearance.

### Goblin characteristics to consider

- Height about three to four feet -- about the size of [[Halflings|halflings]], but a bit bigger and stronger.
- Like [[Elves|elves]], goblins have wide open pupils (darkvision) and pointed ears. Goblin ears are higher on the head, and goblins can move them somewhat to aid in hearing (which is exceptionally keen).
- Goblin vision is excellent up close,  but not particularly acute at distance.
- Sunlight has some deleterious effects on goblins:
	- Initial exposure from dark to bright sunlight (or similarly bright light from light spells, etc.) could cause the dazzled condition for 2-4 rounds.
	- Over time, exposure to sunlight makes goblins gradually sicken or become enfeebled.
