**_Alduvari_**

The most fay of the elves, the Alduvari dwell somewhat apart from the mortal world in a realm partly faerie and partly in the temporal world. As such, it is a land of eternal early summer, but without sun or moon and where time seems to pass slowly or not at all. This land is perilous to mortals.

High [[Elves|elves]] have difficulty living and working in the temporal realm and spend little if any time away from their own otherworldly havens.

Because of the timeless nature of their lands, the lifespan of High Elves is uncertain and, for all practical purposes, they are immortal.

Gray Elves and Sea Elves rever the High Elves as wise lords and often seek their counsel. Even Sylvan [[Elves|elves]] give their elder and more faerie cousins great respect, though they seldom interact.

High Elves are not player characters.
