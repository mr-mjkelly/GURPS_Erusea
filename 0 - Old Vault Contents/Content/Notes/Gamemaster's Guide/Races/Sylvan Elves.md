**_Anduvari_**

The Anduvari (Sylvan Elves or Wood Elves) dwell in small groups of a sort of tribal or clan nature. They live in well concealed (through means both natural and fay) settlements deep in the ancient forests of Erusea.

Rustic hunters and among the least noble of the elves, the Anduvari nevertheless are very attuned to nature and the fay. They are fierce hunters and are unsurpassed in woodcraft.

Wood [[Elves|elves]] tend to among the larger [[Elves|elves]] in size and strength, rivaling humans in height, though not in build. They tend to have darker features as well, with eyes of green or hazel, hair black or brown, and even their skin is lightly tanned. They are not as long-lived as their cousins, but still live 250 to 300 years.

* Note that they are the guardians of the oldest and largest south and the lands of the Danar, and defend it fiercely, controlling travel by water (one or more rivers flow in the forest) and a single road.
