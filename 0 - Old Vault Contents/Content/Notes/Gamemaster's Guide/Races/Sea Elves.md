The sea [[Elves|elves]] dwell on the isles and various coastal locations.
 
They also have their own form of marine "[[The Twilit Paths|twilit ways]]" for sailing to certain faerie places, magical isles, and so on. These "ways" allow travel over great distances in much less time than travel over the worldly seas would take, and can grant access to places not easily reached by normal means.

Sea [[Elves|elves]] are much like [[Grey Elves|grey elves]] in stature and appearance, and also live somewhere around 350 to 500 years.
