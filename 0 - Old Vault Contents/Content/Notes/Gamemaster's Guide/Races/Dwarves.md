Independent of any realm but their own, the dwarves had to struggle for everything they have. This included occasional wars with humans and [[Elves|elves]], as well as with their traditional mortal enemies, [[Giants|giants]] and [[Orcs|orcs]].

The present holding and realms of dwarves have been established by treaties with both humans and [[Elves|elves]], and maintained, when necessary, by force of arms. Dwarves take great stock in contractual agreements, and hold to the traditions of law to a fault at times, but they are trustworthy and honest and keep their holdings, above and below the surface, in order.

Dwarves are generally welcome in [[Humans|human]] realms, as their goods and services are highly valued, and their dealing in matters of precious metal and minerals is a boon to any economy. Although there is still some tension with [[Wood elves|wood elves]], dwarves have been known to deal in goods with them from time to time. Most [[Gray elves|gray elf]] houses and settlements welcome dwarves cordially enough, and trade with them as humans do.
