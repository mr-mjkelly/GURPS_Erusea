Elves in [[The Aldran Age]] are mortal descendants of an ancient race of faerie beings from an elder age. The [[Faerie Realms|faerie realms]] were then somewhat otherworldly and set apart from the temporal world, a realm partway between the abodes of the divine and the land of sun and time.

The ancient immortal [[Elves|elves]] dwelt in a somewhat otherworldly realm in the company of several deities. These deities were powers of the world and were physically present. Thus their powers were limited, as was their lore.

[[Balor]], a power in his own right, and several of his chieftains, were able to challenge these deities and threaten the elven realms. When [[Balor]] unleashed several demons and similar beings, the elven deities decided to further separate and ward their realms. Some [[Elves|elves]] decided to go with them, others to stay in the world.

Bits of the [[Faerie Realms|faerie world]] linger in some places, and [[Elves|elves]] tend to frequent those places, or know of them and consider them sacred or at least significant. The [[The Twilit Paths|Twilit Paths]], which allow [[Elves|elves]] (as well as others with the lore and ability) to travel in ways not possible in the purely temporal world, are vestiges of the ancient elven realms.

#Question: Are they part human?
    - That would explain their ability to breed with humans.

#Question: Pointed ears?

#Question Do [[Elves|elves]] get old? How many years are they hale and hearty vs. elderly? (I am considering making their old age fairly short--the last decade or two of their long lives; they fade late, but then fairly quickly.)

[[High Elves]] have a more formal religion (rituals, holidays, clergy, etc.). Their favored deity is the sky god, [[Osirion]]. [[Osirion|Osirionâ€™s]] sibling bride of the moon and stars, [[Selaris]], is also closely held.

[[Grey Elves]] (Sidhe-like) have little formal religion, although some of their lords and elders worship in the fashion of their mountain cousins. While revering [[Osirion]], [[Selaris]], [[Vanarion]] (the craftsman, smith, delver), et al., grey [[Elves|elves]] tend to focus on the natural world and commune more, as individuals, with local powers, and meditate rather than worship.

[[Sea Elves]] chiefly honor [[Umaro]], high lord of seas and storms.

[[Sylvan Elves]] are essentially animistic, but hold the other deities in reverent regard.
