# Background

PCs are part of a caravan heading through the Blacktail Hills. As the caravan travels, it has spread out along the road and the PCs have taken the lead, serving as a sort of informal scouting party. It is late afternoon when they near the village of Redstone Ford, looking forward to soem warm food and a few points of good brew when they come upon a tragic sight.

## The Corpse

It is clear from a cursory inspection that the horse was hit and likely felled by an arrow. Closer investigation (DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check) will reveal that the arrow is of goblin make. The horse has clearly been hacked and slashed by some sort of blade as well. An obvious drag trail leads to some low brush to the western side of the road.

About 15 yards in the brush is the body of what appears to be a common village man. He too was struck by an arrow and has been slashed by one or more blades. Besides torn and bloody clothes and a single soft leather boot, there is nothing of worth or note on his corpse.

## The Village of Redstone Ford

From the location of the dead villein and horse it is another three miles along the road to Redstone Ford. The village has been attacked and several people have been killed or wounded; many have fled. A few survivors have taken refuge in the granary, which is atop a small hill and is made of strong stone and timber  and is surrounded by a stone wall 10 feet high with a wooden rampart along the interior. The granary also serves as a shrine to some local deities and as a sort of local meeting place.

By the time PCs reach the village a small band of six goblins is still roaming through the village, staying prudently out of bow shot from the walls of the granary. The goblins are alert but not organized well for battle. If confronted, they will fight.

# Into the Hills

## Preparing for Adventure

After the initial battle with those goblins who lagged behind in Redstone village, PCs will likely want to spend some time recovering from the fray and regrouping. They will soon learn that the main band of goblinoid raiders has already departed, and that two of the village women were taken along with foodstuffs, tools, and other items of minor value. It is nearing nightfall and, as Garadoc the Smith will observe:

Garadoc: Nobody in their right mind goes into those woods after sundown!

If any of the goblins survived the fight with the PCs, interrogation is possible. If PCs leave no survivors, one goblin survives and is pulled from is caught hiding in a haystack near the commons. This goblin is not a brave creature and is not particularly difficult to intimidate.

### Prisoner Interrogation

Interrogating Utark the goblin can yield the following results, depending on rolls for Charisma (Intimidation), Charisma (Persuasion) and, if applicable, Intelligence (Investigation). Note that these are general guidelines. Interrogation should be a roleplaying exercise.

Note that a convincing, if not sincere, offer to let Utark go will add +5 to Charisma (Persuasion) checks. If PCs elect to actually release one or more prisoners, they may be intelligent enough to follow or track the prisoner(s) in hopes of find the lair. It may also occur to PCs to bring a reluctant guide with them, but that is fraught with peril as the prisoner will try to escape or otherwise work a situation to his advantage.

Roll Resulting Information

≧ 10 Utark will reveal that he is part of a larger band hidden in a stronghold in the hills to the east. If pressed for details about the route to the goblinoid lair, he will reluctantly reveal a route to the ogre’s cave instead, which is what he was instructed to do. He will not reveal that his leaders will likely waylay the trail as well, which is their usual tactic.

≧ 15 Utark will reveal that the goblinoid leader is a strong hobgoblin and is trying to establish a permanent stronghold in the hills and is trying to make a name for himself. He will still only reveal the route to the lair, but will not warn PCs that his leader will likely plan an ambush.

≧ 20 Utark will give details of the trip (including some landmarks) to guide PCs to the lair on a route that is not likely to bring them near the ogre’s lair, but will not mention the ogre or the lair. He will also mention that the band includes a mix of goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, and worgs.

≧ 25 Utark will spill most anything asked, including some details about the hideout itself and the number of goblinoids and allies in it. He will tell PCs the name of the hobgoblin leader (Larshog) and his own name (Utark). He will also mention the ambush, and warn PCs of the ogre lair, giving some details about how to avoid it.

#### Experience
    
If PCs successfully interrogate Utark, divide 50 x.p. among them. Award an additional +5 x.p. to divide amongst the group for each successful DC of of 20 or more.

### The Caravan Vanguard

A troop of ten mounted men-at-arms in the charge of a young but experienced knight-captain (Sir Brien Aldwell) will arrive in the early morning, just after dawn. Sir Brien will summon Garadoc and PCs to a small council to learn what he can of any threats to the approaching caravan, which is his primary responsibility. His employer has also made it clear that his duties include support for making travel safe, and that includes providing reasonable aid to the settlements along the route to Riverthorn. As such, while Sir Brien cannot spare any of his own men, or take the time to embark on a rescue or punitive expedition, he can offer bounty to freelance adventurers who might be interested. The offer is as follows:

-   50 g.p. for each goblin
    
-   100 g.p. for each hobgoblin
    
-   300 g.p. for Larshog.
    
-   500 g.p. for the safe return of the kidnapped village women (or — discreetly — 100 g.p. for their bodies 

Sir Brien will inform PCs that “the Standard Freelance Customs apply,” so all loot is fair salvage for PCs unless it is specifically earmarked as off limits by a lord or sovereign, or similar eccesiastical authority. (etc., etc. ...)

# The Forest

Read Aloud to Players:

The woods beneath the western slopes of the Blacktail Hills are a mix of hardwood and evergreen. They are wild and thick, and there is plenty of game and forage to be had for those with the skills to harvest them. Within a half mile or so of the road to Riverthorn the woods occasionally show signs of forestry and similar activities. There are tree stumps and some clearings where wood was felled and collected for hauling out. Signs of old fires and camps, all long unused, appear from time to time.

The track PCs follow, whether they are trailing Utark or following his guidance, is essentially a game trail with some signs of human (or at least humanoid) travel. As it gradually climbs to the hills, evergreens begin to replace the hardwoods, and the soil gives way to more and more bare rock.

## Traveling by Day

While traveling, Utark is going to be busy in any supervised moments dropping signs that he is a captive of some force or group and wants to be rescued. His actions are noticeable on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. If he is specifically being watched (that is, if a player specifies that he is guarding/watching Utark), the Wisdom (Perception) check is at DC 10.

If the goblinoid/worg patrol is encountered, there is a 25% (1 on 1d4) chance that they are alerted by Utark’s signs and will be actively trying to sneak up and surprise the captors.

### Encounters in the Day

Roll twice for encounters during the day. An encounter resulting from the first roll should occur before noon; an encounter from the second roll should occur after noon but before evening.

D20 Encounter

1-8 No encounter.

9-11 Grulmogsh (See below)

12-14 Goblinoid/worg patrol (See below)

15 Black bear. Will only attack if injured, else will head off.

16 Wolves. Only the lead she-wolf will show herself. Other wolves will be hidden (DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) to spot) and will only attack if first wolf noticed is provoked.

17-20 Hippogriff screaming while passing overhead.

## Night in the Forest

### Encounters at Night

Roll for an encounter once each watch, but no more than four times in a night in any case. If PCs start a fire, ignore the first result of 8 or lower and roll again for an encounter.

D20 Encounter

1-8 No encounter.

9-10 Grulmogsh the ogre (See below)

11-13 Goblinoid/worg patrol (See below)

14 Black bear. Will only attack if injured, else will head off.

15 Wolves. Only the lead she-wolf will show herself. Other wolves will be hidden (DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) to spot) and will only attack if first wolf noticed is provoked.

16-20 Elshi the Dryad.

## Encounter Notes

### Elshi the Dryad

Elshi will approach any party of good-aligned people, especially if there is an elf, half-elf, or halfling among them, or perhaps a druid or cleric of a sylvan deity. She will only approach at night, and will prefer to contact someone of elf blood over others. Her approach will be furtive, and she will try to use stealth to move close enough to the party and any posted sentries to speak with them if she decides to.

During the night, roll for each shift of party sentries (or roll once every two hours if the PCs do not post sentries). Elshi will appear on a roll of 1-2 on a d6. She is more likely to speak to elves, half-elves, or halflings than humans, and druids or similar humans more than others. She is not likely to contact a dwarf, and will not make contact with a half-orc.

Roll d6 to determine whether she makes contact after appearing, depending on whom, if anyone, is standing watch:

Elf, half-elf, and halfling 1-4

Human druid or similar 1-3

Human (non-druid) 1-2

Dwarf 1

Elshi will not like the presence of Utark, but will be mollified if she can determine that he is a captive of a party interested in dealing with the goblinoids of the stronghold. She will want to move out of earshot and sight of the goblin to talk with PCs.

If the contact goes well, Elshi will ask for some help dealing with Grulmogsh, who has been getting closer to finding her tree and doing her harm. She is also concerned about the goblinoids and worgs. While Elshi has little of material worth to offer, she can warn PCs that they are heading toward danger and help them understand that Utark is misguiding them. Elshi senses that evil is a growing presence in her home and will confide that if the conversation progresses.

-   #### Experience
    

A successful encounter with Elshi that yields information about the goblinoid stronghold, the ogre, and a sense that there is something more afoot in the Blacktail Hills area, divide 50 x.p. among the party.

### Goblinoid/Worg Patrol

A hobgoblin and two goblins mounted on worgs patrol the route to the stronghold. They are being stealthy and have a chance to catch unwary PCs off guard. If PCs are also being stealthy, there is a chance for some or all members of both groups to be surprised. This patrol is ready for a fight, but its primary mission is to keep the stronghold informed and alert them to any danger.

Upon encountering PCs, the hobgoblin patrol leader will certainly engage. If it appears that the fight will not be short and that the patrol might be defeated, the leader will bark orders to one goblin and worg to ride off to warn the stronghold that the PCs are in the area.

Note that worgs speak the goblin tongue, so even if the worg escapes without its rider, that can still serve as a warning to the stronghold’s occupants that there are enemies in the area.

-   #### Experience
    

-   If PCs succeed in ambushing the patrol and prevent any goblins from escaping to warn their compatriots in the stronghold, award an additional 100 x.p. to be divided among them.
    
-   If the PCs avoid being surprised by the patrol after it has been alerted by Utark’s signs, award an additional 100 x.p. among them, assuming they succeed in the attempt to prevent any goblins from fleeing.
    

### Grulmogsh the Ogre

Encountering Grulmogsh at night is almost certain to occur if PCs start a fire or otherwise make their presence known. A recent fight with a roaming goblin patrol guarantees Grulmogsh will come to the site if PCs are unwise enough to remain there for an hour or more.

Alert PCs (DC 15 passive Wisdom (Perception) check) might notice Utark growing apprehensive as the night passes, particularly if they start a fire, use bright light, or have a noisy combat. He is not likely to reveal the reasons for his concern to observant PCs if he has not already mentioned the ogre to them. He might respond to further interrogation for details, however.

Grulmogsh is a typical ogre in most respects and, if encountered, will definitely fight unless so absolutely overmatched that even his dim with overcomes his pernicious nature in favor of discretion and possibly flight. Too stupid to negotiate, Grulmogsh will not engage in conversation for more than a few sentences. In most cases he will spend that time advancing on his enemies or readying his javelin for a go.

For more details about Grulmogsh, see the Grulmogsh’s Cave area description below. PCs may choose to track Grulmogsh if they are aware that he has a lair, or if it simply occurs to them to investigate the possibility. He will not be difficult to track if they elect to work their way to his cave.

-   #### Experience
    

If the PCs successfully defeat Grulmogsh, divide 450 x.p. among them.

# The Hills

## Ambush

Check to see which, if any, combatants are surprised. Once surprise is over, or if it is not an issue, read the description aloud.

Read Aloud to Players:

As you round a bend and pass alongide an immense boulder, you have come into a steep draw. The trail follows up the draw heading east and then curving north. On your left, to the north, great boulders have fallen from the hillside creating a steep, brush-filled jumble rising 30 ft. to 40 ft. above the trail. You can hear the beligerent cries of goblins concealed behind the high rocks and brush.

A hobgoblin, a bugbear, and three goblins lay in wait 30 ft. above the trail, in a jumble of huge rocks and thick scrub. They are in good ambush position. If they achieve surprise or initiative, the three goblins will attack with their bows (thus revealing their position). The hobgoblin and bugbear are hidden deeper in the bushes and a bit higher up the rocky rise. The hobgoblin leader is shrewd enough to encourage his archers to target any likely magic users first, if they are discernible from other types by action, wardrobe, or similar cues. If not, the goblins will simply target the dwarves if they see any, or any enemy with the ability to shoot or hurl weapons at them. The goblins have ¾ cover (+5 to AC and Dexterity saves).

Although the goblinoids have the high ground, there are some tactical disadvantages. PCs can quickly move to the base of the rocks to gain ¾ cover themselves, and can move up the rocks (as difficult terrain, 2x cost to movement) at a slow pace while maintaining half cover (+2 to AC and Dexterity saves) if they make a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check. Given the terrain, and the fact that the effort is a climb, a Dash action is not possible.

The ambushers are not mounted, and if overcome, the goblins will either flee or surrender depending on the situation. The hobgoblin and bugbear will fight to the death if they are able.

## Grulmogsh’s Cave

The cavern lair of Grulmogsh the Ogre has a bit of history. More than two decades ago it served as the hideout of a group of brigands. Those brigands were done in by a marauding hill giant who routed them out of the cave and took up residence himself for a number of years. However, this giant’s activities in the area raised the ire of some local warriors and he returned one day to his lair with a serious wound. He died a few days later, leaving the cavern unoccupied, and its secrets and treasures unattended, until Grulmogsh happened upon it and made it his home.

### Exterior

Read Aloud to Players:

As you follow the deep footprints made by the ogre south through the woods you come to a low ridge. The trail takes you up and over the ridge and down into a dell with a quick, noisy stream running through it. The tracks end at the stream, which is rapid but shallow and easily forded. Crossing the stream, you pick up the trail easily and continue south, bending quickly to the southwest as you head slightly uphill. The tracks quickly become a clear and well-trodden trail. In a short while you reach a steep rock face in the hillside to the east. A small stream running northwest from a waterfall cascading fifty or more feet down the rocky wall. The trail leads to a series of well-placed rocks in the stream that make crossing the current easy while staying dry. A trail leads to the southeast, toward the cliff side.

This dooryard area before the cave is perhaps surprisingly picturesque, at least at first. As PCs approach the cliffside, more signs indicating the type of occupant appear. Bones and other animal (and perhaps even some humanoid) parts litter the ground at the base of the cliff, just beneath a narrow sloping ramp that rises steeply northwest up the rock toward the top of the waterfall. A search of this area yields little of note except for some odd bits of clothing and gear (buttons, buckles, some rotting leather) and the remainder of a very rusted and battered helm.

The climb up the rocky ramp requires a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Anyone failing the check will fall 10 ft. to 40 ft. (roll 1d4 and multiply by ten to determine the height of the fall) unless they make a DC 15 Dexterity save. On a successful save, the individual will fall prone on the ramp, perhaps hanging over the edge, and will require two rounds to get back up again.

If he has not already been dealt with elsewhere, Grumolgsh will be in residence. Toward evening, there is a 20% (1-4 on 1d20) chance he will be outside near the stream crossing. Otherwise he will be in his lair resting or, in the evening, eating.

### Interior

#### Areas of Interest

##### 1. Entry Cavern

Read Aloud to Players:

You pass through a small curtain of water and mist from the side of the main waterfall and enter a natural cavern with a ceiling about 10 ft. above you. To your left (west) as you enter, the falls form a moving glassy curtain of water and make a pleasant rushing noise. The cavern smell of fresh moisture, mossy and earthy, and the waterfall creates a slight breeze that forms cool droplets your gear, garments, and skin. The cavern seems to open wide to the east into a large open chamber with a ceiling varying from 15 ft. to 20 ft. high. The floor is rough but generally level, with few minor mineral deposits, but no stalagmites or columns. Similarly, the cavern ceiling has little in the way of mineral formations and is mostly naked stone.

No open flames, such as torches, can pass through the water to enter the cavern without being extinguished. Lanterns are able to pass through while lighted. In the daytime there is enough dim light to find and light a lantern or torch.

A. Grulmogsh’s “armory”

In this nook the ogre has stashed three crude spears, a greatclub, and some odd and poorly made (essentially inoperable) flail-like thing of sinew, stones, and wood.

B. Boulder pile

This pile of stones stands about 4 ft. high. The stones are similar in size and shape, and look almost formed in some cases. They are basically sperical, plain, and about 2 ft. in diameter. Moss covers them, and it looks as though the pile has not been disturbed for many years. PCs searching the pile by pulling the rocks off for about ten minutes may make a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a wedge-shaped stone with some across the center of it on both sides. A DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check will allow a PC to deduce that the stone might have been the head of a crude hammer.

##### 2. Chasm

Read Aloud to Players:

A deep and narrow fissure runs roughly north to south from just before the midway point of the cavern’s eastern side all the way to the end. It appears to continue to the south about 10 ft. to 15 ft. before the rock closes in on it, but there is no floor in that direction. Looking north, the chasm continues like a gaping, jagged maw in the cavern walls from above the ceiling to the impenetrable depths below. The air is moving in little drafts from that direction.

Across this abyss there is a large stone slab nearly 3 ft. wide and 1 ft. thick. The slab spans the 12 ft. distance with little to spare, but appears to be stable. A cursory check indicates mud and other signs that the ogre has used it as a bridge. The ogre clearly wants no visitors: to either side of the slab, at its western end, are wooden poles set in crude rock cairns. On each pole is a humanoid skeleton of some sort, long stripped of any flesh or belonings.

This chasm is over 200 ft. deep and ends in a jagged shallow watery bottom. 

Examination of the skeletons on the poles will reveal, on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check that the northernmost are gob

Trap

If Grumolgsh is in his lair, he will have rigged a crude trap on the stone slab. At the eastern end of the slab he will have carefully set the slab so that, if enough additional weight is placed on it, the slab will abruptly tilt sideways to the south, spilling anyone on it without additional support measures, into the depths below. This trap can be sprung by a medium sized creature, or by two small creatures, or any combination that puts similar weight on the slab. When the first of anyone crossing reaches the midpoint of the slab, the trap is spring on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6 and the slab abruptly rolls sideways. A DC 20 Dexterity save allows an individual to fall prone onto the slab rather than falling into the abyss. Individuals with Acrobatics proficiency may make an additional DC 20 Dexterity (Acrobatics) roll to spring forward or backward to one side of the chasm or the other (roll 1d6, 1-3 for springing forward, 4-6 for springing backward).

After the initial roll, the slab is unstable and will definitely shift and drop into the chasm, carrying anyone prone on it to their deaths, and requiring anyone standing on it to make Dexterity saves and Acrobatics checks as described above.

The sound of the slab shifting and rolling will likely alert Grumolgsh that he has intruders. Grumolgsh is often asleep in his lair (1-4 on 1d6). If he is asleep, have the ogre make a DC 20 passive Wisdom (Perception) check to awaken. If he is a awake, the DC is 15.

##### 3. Passage

Read Aloud to Players:

The ceiling in this long passage is lower than that of the larger chamber before, and ranges from 8 ft. to as much as 12 ft. in the center. It is irregular, but seems to form a peak near the center for most of the length. The footing on the floor is generally as level as can be expected of living stone. The air in this tunnel is dryer and relatively still compared to the larger cavern and fissure, but it is still fresh and there is some condenstation on the stony surfaces that reflects and refracts light in glints and sparkles.

The passage heads to the southeast unremarkably, then, about 30 ft. t0 40 ft. later, turns about 90 degrees to the northeast. At about 20 ft. the wall to the east gives way to a ledge over the floor of another cavern chanber even larger than the earlier one by the fissure. The ledge drops nearly 40 ft. to the floor below. The ceiling, starting from that floor, ranges from 30 ft. to 40 ft. in some places. The path along the ledge gradually slopes downward. It narrows just as it reaches a steeper slope and some natural step-like formations. At this point, the ledge is about 30 ft. above the floor below, and the path dives downward more steeply, at about a sixty degree slope, to the level of the floor below. Despite the steep slope, footing is good and no exceptional effort or caution is required to descend.

A. Bats

A small colony of bats resides in this cavern, and any activity or light has a chance of disturbing 100-2000 (10d20 x 10) of them if they are resting during daylight hours (at night they will not be in the caverns, but out hunting for food). On a roll of 1 or 2 on 1d6 the bats are disturbed and will swarm anyone causing the disturbance, flying around for 1d4 + 3 rounds before settling back down again. The bats are harmless (if annoying), but their sudden activity might tip Grumolgsh off that he has intruders, and he may prepare himself in his lair or move to attack. While bats are swarming around the characters visibility is lightly obscured and all ability checks requiring vision, and all attacks, are at a disadvantage.

Trap

Just at this point where the path along the ledge narrows enough to require those traveling it to move single file Grumolgsh has set another crude trap. A deliberately set loose stone is disguised to look like part of the first natural tread of the stairs at this point. This trap is not difficult to spot, and can be detected with a DC 15 passive Wisdom (Perception) check. Anyone actively searching for a trap at this location will discover the trap, and merely stepping over that particular stone avoids it. However, anyone moving through will dislodge this stone, which will in turn dislodge a number of larger boulders wedged in the western wall, causing them to tumble out in a minor avalanche. That poor individual will be struck by the rocks, taking 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage and, unless they make a DC 15 Dexterity save, will be pushed over the ledge to the west and take 6 (2d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall.

The sound of the avalanche caused by this trap will echo loudly and will likely (1-5 on 1d6) disturb the bat colony (see A. Bats, above). It is also more likely to alert Grumolgsh than the shifting slab in at area 2. Grumolgsh is asleep on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. If he is asleep, have the ogre make a DC 15 passive Wisdom (Perception) check to awaken. If he is a awake, the DC is 10.

##### 4. Lower Cavern

Read Aloud to Players:

From the base of the sloping stone ramp you can see the edge of a pool or large puddle to the east. Just to the north of the water’s edge the cavern continues northeast. To the south the cavern opens wide into darkness. The ceiling here is naturally irregular, and it ranges in height from 30 ft. to 40 ft. or more before going out of reach of torchlight. Much of the ceiling is masked in shadows and crannies. The sound of water flowing and splashing as if from a waterfall echoes around the chamber, and seems to be coming from somewhere to the south. The air here is fresh and cool, with the now familiar moisture condensing on skin and gear.

In the northeast is a cliff wall leading to another section of cavern. The wall is 12 ft. high. Grulmogsh has a wooden ladder he uses to climb into the upper section, which serves as his personal chambers.

If Grulmogsh has been alerted by activities in 2. and 3. (traps), he will appear at the top of the ledge and challenge the party who has invaded his lair.

##### 5. Pool

This large pool is fed by a few submerged springs and a waterfall in the far southwest. The depth varies, and the bottom is jagged and irregular. On the western edge, the pool slopes abruptly to a depth of about 4 ft. and then, about 5 ft. from the edge, drops quickly in most places to about 8 ft.. In the wider northern section the water gets as deep as 12 ft. to 15 ft. near the center, and is at least 8 ft. deep along the northern wall. There are a few places in the southern section where a medium sized person can stand. Anyone struggling in the water can come upon one of these sections on a roll of 1-2 on 1d6.

A. Ruined Boat

This small one-person craft was once used by the brigands who occupied this cavern. It was primarily used to secure treasure in a small alcove in the pool (see B., below). Now it has rotted to the point where only the keel and a few slats remain. Right next to it is a humanoid skeleton. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check can determine that the skeleton is indeed human. Anyone diligently searching it and removing some of the dried and rotting wood can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find a small sack containing:

-   30 g.p. in coins    
-   a gold ring with a garnet gem worth 50 g.p.
    
B. Hidden Treasure

This small alcove is shallow, only about 1 ft. to 2 ft. deep. Secured in a natural shelf are a barely intact iron bound wooden chest that has nearly rotted and rusted apart and a remarkable well preserved box of some sort of very polished black stone.

In the chest:

-   200 g.p., 350 s.p., and 500 c.p. in coin
    
-   Two silver chalices worth 30 g.p. each
    
-   A silver platter worth 50 g.p.
    
-   A silver brooch pin with a small pearl setting worth 8 g.p.
    
-   A silvered dagger with a gold and silver wire wrapped hilt and a silver bear’s head pommel with garnet gem eyes worth 100 g.p. This particular item is effective against creatures vulnerable to silver, such as lycanthropes.
    
-   Two crossbow bolts with silvered heads, also effective against creatures vulnerable to silver, and worth 10 s.p. each. 

In the stone box:

The box is locked and requires a DC 20 Dexterity check to open without damaging the lock or the box. The box can be forced open, but doing so will break it and reduce or ruin its value. Undamaged, the box alone is worth 75 g.p.

The box contains three potions carefully wrapped flasks cushioned in somewhat aged and moldy shearling wool:

-   Potion of Healing
    
-   Potion of Resistance (to necrotic damage)
    
-   Potion of Invulnerability
    

##### 6. Upper Cavern

If Grumolgsh is in residence (meaning he has not been otherwise dealt with), and has not been alerted, he may be asleep in the afternoon or early evening (1 on 1d4). Otherwise, if he is not forewarned by activities as previously detailed in areas 2. and 3., above, he could be surprised in one or more PCs can stealthily climb up the 12 ft. cliff to his lair. In the evening Grumolgsh is likey (1-4 on 1d6) to have a fire and something — or perhaps someone — roasting on it. If this is the case, anyone sneaking up to his level has a +2 bonus to their Dexterity (Stealth) check.

Surprised or not, Grumolgsh will not be pleased to have visitors, and will attack furiously.

Read Aloud to Players

The cavern area into which you have ascended is really just an extension the the larger cavern below. The ceiling here is a bit lower, slanting downward to the northeast in a sort of lean-to fashion such that it is nearly 20 ft. from the floor of this cavern on the southwestern side and only 10 ft. or so high on the northeastern side. The stone here is relatively smooth and regular, almost as if a single great slab formed the roof. The floor is also fairly level and smooth, and somewhat worn in places from foot traffic and other activity. There is a vague sooty smell, and perhaps something worse. A large pile of wood and a fire pit can be seen to the southeast, and the stone of the walls and ceiling around that area are blackened with soot and grime.

A. Hill Giant Skeleton

The remains of the hill giant who once dwelt in this cavern remain much as they lay when he died. Grumolgsh, partly out of a sort of grudging respect, and mostly due to dimwitted superstition, has refrained from disturbing the giant’s bones. To anyone examining the skeleton, it is obvious that they are a giant’s. A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check will reveal that it is a hill giant to anyone bothering to inspect them.

B. Firepit

A large pile of wood has been gathered and dumped beside a large fire circle. If Grumolgsh has a fire going, some sort of meat from a large animal (1-5 on 1d6) or a goblinoid (6 on 1d6) will be skewered on a large pole of green wood that is levered on a rock as a fulcrum and anchored by another rock. There is no stone ring remaining from this fire pit, although it is possible there once was one given the scattered arrayment of stones in and around the fire.

C. Treasure

While Grulmogsh has not been particularly prosperous in his life, he was fortunate enough to be the accidental heir to the treasures collected by the brigands who once used this cave and dell as a home.

# The Lair

Larshog and several of his miscreant goblinoid band have settled in atop this stony hill and have been busy making it more defensible and, to a lesser extent, habitable. Regardless of whether he has been warned of approaching enemies, Larshog will is not going to send any more of his band into the forest hills, preferring to keep a reasonable contingent on the hilltop. He will ensure that the guards are more alert and in position, paying particular attention to the bridge. His lookouts, posted near the southern slopes of the bluff, will be alert for any intrusion from that direction, even having a decent chance (DM discretion) of spotting distant smoke from camp fires and other clear signs. For the most part, however, the hilltop is blind to any remotely stealthy small party until someone reaches the rocky crest of the hill where vegetation is sparse and the approaches offer little concealment or chance of silence.

### Approach to the Bluff

A track leads around the western side of the bluff to the northern slope and can be followed past two ravines to a more gradual ascent up to the summit. Following this track leads PCs to a point about 20 ft. from the eastern edge of the large ravine. Following this edge south will lead them to the bridge.

Two goblins in a guard post just to the northwest of the bridge are reasonably alert, particularly if Larshog has been warned by his patrol that intruders are nearby. If they have received warning, they are actively watching the bridge and the far side of the chasm on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Otherwise, they are less alert and will only be watching 1-4 on 1d6 after sundown, or 1-3 on 1d6 during daylight. Cover is sparse and anyone approaching is in the open. In any case, it is effectively impossible to cross the bridge without being heard or seen if the guards are alert. Even if they are not, anyone trying to cross the bridge has a -10 penalty to their Dexterity (Stealth) check.

### Notes

-   Unless otherwise noted, goblins have scant personal treasure worth at most 15 s.p. Hobgoblins will typically have a bit more: 20-30 s.p. Such treasure is in a mix of coin, arm bands, neck chains, and earrings.
    

### Areas of Interest

#### 1. The Ravines

The westernmost ravine offers a means for anyone with decent climbing skill to scale up the narrow cleft from east to west. Various rocky overhangs and thick brush offer good concealment along the ravine bottom from any chance watchers from above. The terrain is difficult, costing double movement to progress to the western end where a final vertical 40 ft. climb is easiest (DC 15 Climb checks).

The larger eastern ravine offers two feasible approaches to the summit, both located near the southern end. Like the smaller western ravine, travel along the bottom of this ravine while using stealth and hiding is relatively easy.

#### 1. Wooden Bridge

This bridge is a crude but rugged rope and log bridge consisting of two parallel rows of logs split lengthwise and suspended by ropes. The logs serve as a narrow 2 ft. wide platform for walking and the long support ropes serve as hand rails. Large logs driven into the ground at either end of the bridge anchor the ropes. The suspension ropes each have AC 11 and 5 hit points, and are thick enough to require a DC 25 Strength check to simply break. The ropes are immune to bludgeoning damage. The anchor logs each have AC 15, 20 hit points, and are DC 30 to break. The plank logs are each 10 ft. long, have AC 15 and 15 hit points and are DC 30 to break.

#### 2. Eastern Watchpost

Two goblins guard this outpost. Their primary purpose is to watch the approach to and across the wooden bridge. As noted earlier, these two are likely to be alert if the stronghold has been warned by his patrol that intruders are nearby. If they have received warning, they are actively watching the bridge and the far side of the chasm on a roll of 1-5 on 1d6. Otherwise, they are less alert and will only be watching 1-4 on 1d6 after sundown, or 1-3 on 1d6 during daylight. If they spot anyone approaching the bridge, they will sound an alarm and summon the roving hobgoblin patrol (below) and the worg from Southern Watchpost 2. Each of these groups will take 1-4 rounds to arrive when summoned by the cries of the sentries. If possible, the goblins will attack targets in range with their shortbows in hopes of stopping or at least interfering with any attempt to cross the bridge. If they believe they will be overwhelmed, they will attempt to retreat to Southern Watchpost 4.

##### Hobgoblin Patrol

 Two hobgoblins make rounds of the every few hours. They inspect each watchpost, the bridge, check that the posted guards are vigilant, and so on. When the PCs arrive at the base of the hill, roll a d8 to determine where the guards are at that time. After the first roll, roll once each half hour to check on them.

D8 Patrol Location

1 Inspecting the bridge, on the western side.

2 Inspecting the bridge, on the eastern side.

3 Inspecting the easter guard post.

4 Patrolling the large ravine north of the bridge.

5 Patrolling the large ravine south of the bridge.

6 Inspecting southern watchpost 1

7 Inspecting southern watchpost 2

8 In the leader’s hut.

If any PCs are in the vicinity of these patrolling guards’ location, roll appropriate Dexterity (Hide) and Dexterity (Stealth) checks to see who, if anyone, becomes aware of nearby enemies. Detecting the approach of these two guards is not difficult (DC 10 Perception check to see or hear them). If PCs are hiding in the ravine, the guards will make passive Perception checks to notice them if the hilltop has not been alerted to intruders in the nearby forests. If the brigands have been warned, the patrol will be actively searching as they patrol, and will make Perception checks to detect hiding PCs. Note that anyone actually climbing up the last 40’ of rock will not be able to hide and will be detected by this patrol if the hobgoblins are in the vicinity.

##### 3. Southern Watchpost 1

Three goblins are stationed here. They are less generally alert under normal circumstances. If they have received warning, they are alert on a roll of 1-4 on 1d6. Otherwise, they are less alert and will only be watching 1-3 on 1d6 after sundown, or 1-2 on 1d6 during daylight. If they spot anyone approaching, they too will sound an alarm and summon the roving hobgoblin patrol (below) and the worgs from Southern Watchpost 2. Each of these groups will take 1-4 rounds to arrive when summoned by the cries of the sentries, who will attack targets in range with their shortbows if possible.

##### 4. Southern Watchpost 2

This is a strongpoint on the highest ground on the summit. A hobgoblin, two goblins, and two worgs are posted here. They are near the boss’s hut and are alert. If they detect intruders, they will attack aggressively as well as sounding the alarm. Note that the worgs will not be present if they responded to alerts from other posts and did not return.

##### 6. Leader’s Hut

This crude log pole hut has a roof of cut branches, now dried and brown. It is about 8 ft. to the pole beams that support the roof; the peakc of the roof is 12 ft. above the floor and has gap in the branch thatching that serves as a smoke hole for the fire pit in the center of the room. The floor is rocky and somewhat uneven, but nothing that interferes with movement or combat. A few scattered furs and hides serve as bedding for the few hobgoblins allowed to rest in the hut, and they are mostly off to the side of the hut.

This is were Larshog, the bandit leader, will make his last stand. He and his two henchmen will fight aggressively. If the fight goes poorly, or Larshog realizes he is clearly overmatched, he will grab one of his female village captives and try to bargain for his life (and perhaps the lives of any of his surviving comrades).

###### Captives

The two village women are here. They are alive, but much the worse for wear. Their feet are bound, and they cower against the wall in a fairly dazed state even after they are rescued. If liberated, they will take 1-2 hours to recover from their fugue enough to recognize that they are being rescued and brought back to their village. However, for the most part, they are not active or particularly responsive.

###### Treasure

Larshog keeps his treasure in his bedding. Two sacks contain the following items:

-   45 g.p., 285 s.p., and 324 c.p. in coin.
    
-   12 silver spoons each worth 5 s.p. (60 s.p. total).
    
-   4 copper goblets with silver rims and a silver swan emblem. Each worth 2 g.p. (8 g.p. total)
    
-   A masterwork leather belt with silver embellishments and buckle worth 50 g.p.
    

Additionally, there is a scabbard for a longsword to match the belt in the sacks. It is worth 70 g.p. 

Beneath the blankets, wrapped in some hide, there is also an axe of dwarven make with a handle of highly polished almost black wood and three rubies set at even intervals along the haft. The blade is highly polished (and is in fact

On his person, in a pair of belt pouches, Larshog has 15 g.p., 50 s.p., and a pair of gold arm rings worth 20 g.p. each.

Larshog’s two henchmen are better off than most of their fellows. Each has a gold arm ring worth 10 g.p. (a badge of authority as well as wealth). One has a belt pouch with 8 g.p., 30 s.p., and 50 c.p. The other has a small sack tied off as a belt pouch containing a small, feminine silver necklace worth 15 s.p., a silver ring with a turquoise stone setting worth 15 gp.p, 12 g.p., and 23 s.p.
