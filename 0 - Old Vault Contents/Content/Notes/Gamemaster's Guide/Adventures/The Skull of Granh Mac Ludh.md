**Note:** (Conceived 30 November 2017)

Someone has plundered the tomb of an old sorcerer of some local renown and taken his skull! Now the town of Hyleway is plagued by restless spirits, walking corpses, and wild animals. It is even said that the shade of Granh Mac Ludh haunts the woods and meadows.

Granh Mac Ludh was reputedly an irascible and wayward, but respectably powerful sorcerer nearly a century ago. Stories of his exploits have been sung for at least three generations. He was, however, a local hero because he helped the warriors of the local clans bring down a particularly aggressive army of northern barbarians, taking their two wizards down in the process.

Mac Ludh died at an old but indeterminate age and was buried in a tomb not far from (but not too close to…) the grave mounds of various strong local lords and warriors.

PCs should venture to the old temple, locate and defeat the cabal of evil priests of some hideous and malign deity before they can use Granh Mac Ludh’s skull in some dark ritual, and return the old sorcerer’s skull to its proper resting place to quiet the sorcerer’s restless spirit — which should, by the way, be a ghost or some such and actually a factor in the adventure.

The temple complex should be the primary dungeon. It is a classic dungeon, with some aboveground ruins that warrant a bit of exploration, but with a multi-level underground complex as the primary action location. The antagonist priests are not long-time residents, and in fact do not totally control all areas of the dungeon. They have penetrated and somewhat secured the areas the need for their ritual purposes, but otherwise the place is ripe for exploration in the dungeon crawl fashion. (I have not decided what other menaces, obstacles, curiosities, and rewards await PCs yet…)

The levels of the temple are deep below the ground. The first level is fairly straightforward, and is reached by a long and steep winding stair/slope tunnel with some hazardous obstacles. This level has scattered spaces populated with unorganized monsters and the odd traps on some entries or items. There are signs of looting, and perhaps some indication (to experts) that goblins of a certain tribe have been around.

Goblins have indeed been around, and they occupy another region of this dungeon. The goblins have found a second entrance/exit to their portion of the complex — a natural chain of caverns that end in a one or two out of which a stream flows. The goblins widened the outlet, creating a well-concealed portal that they have trapped and which they guard well. Additionally, there is a deep chasm about 15' wide that is spanned by a single stone slab, which serves as a second defense choke point.

From within the dungeon, the entrance to the goblin lair for this band (part of a greater tribe known to rangers and other experts in the region; they are apart due to some goblin politics...) comes off of the first major bridge and door from the “Great Stair.” This entrance has signs of goblin traffic and occupation, and is barred by a great stone door that will be somewhat tricky to breach without determined effort and heavy equipment. (It does, however, open occasionally, when goblins come and go, and so might be entered through ambush or subterfuge.) There are a few goblin guards stationed up the stairwell and farther down the stairwell, hanging out in hollowed chambers along the stair.

The Great Stair is a centerpiece, almost literally, of the dungeon. It is a long spiral stair that winds, somewhat tortuously, around the irregular contours of an immense hanging stone that tapers to a point over a vast and seemingly bottomless chasm. This stairwell is a _thing_ for sure. It has its own obstacles, maybe even a trap or two, some chambers (presumably for guarding and supplies once upon a time), and bridges of stone or ancient and dubious wood, and wind (inconveniently and randomly messing with torches, etc.), noise, moisture (slippery, slow going...), etc. There might even be some creatures located in inconvenient spots.

The temple complex of interest to the evil clerics (yes, I need a name for their deity — or pantheon — and some details about their Lovecraftian religion) is the next major area below the goblin lair. The clerics paid a toll to the goblin chief, and still pay an occasional tribute to him as they come and go. This has produced an uneasy truce — and perhaps there are opportunities for adventurers to undermine this pact to their advantage, particularly if they can persuade the goblins that it is in their interest not to deal with clerics of this particular stripe. In any case, the clerics and some of their more martial adherents pass the goblin area on the stairwell in some force and with some intimidating magic and presentation to awe the goblins a bit. The clerics leave a guard on their area; the goblins maintain a guard below their section of the Great Stair. Trust but verify.  
The clerics are trying to summon a creature revered by their cult, which they hope to unleash to cause some mayhem and woe. Granh Mac Ludh's skull is important in their ritual. Their temple room should have sculptures and reliefs and horrible items that leave little doubt to its nature and their intent. In another chamber is a great portal leading to a very wide rough hewn passage that slopes down into abyssal darkness (and terminates in the same chasm that underlies the Great Stair). If the clerics actually succeed in their full ritual, something (Some Thing!) will be summoned. If they fail (and the power of the skull, and the guile of the late Granh Mac Ludh will help ensure that they fail), other creatures will come. Troglodytes aplenty.

And the flight from the dungeon will begin — and perhaps an epic fight that bards will sing of for ages.
