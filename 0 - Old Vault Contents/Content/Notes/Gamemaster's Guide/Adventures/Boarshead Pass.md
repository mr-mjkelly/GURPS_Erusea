# Introduction

Boarshead Pass is a notoriously dangerous shortcut around a particularly steep and rugged range of mountains to the north and west of the crossroads village of Dolfyrdd. Dolfyrdd residents and nearby freeholds make a reasonable living in the fertile land along the Twythyl River.
# Background

Local history overview, some more current events, significant people, etc. Include notes about the significance of the pass and what is (and is believed to be...) over it.

## Stolen Chalice

Lughryd the Merchant is the unhappy victim of two bandits who posed as fellow travelers and then stole a valuable chalice he was to deliver to a lord to the north and west. The chalice was a gift from the leader of a southern warband, and a gesture of allegiance. It is worth 50 gp. Lughryd is not happy that his six guards and their captain, Cerdric, allowed two (“Two!”) bandits to escape with the chalice, along with some other items of lesser value. As soon as his caravan reaches Dolfyrdd, he has Cerdric post a call for volunteers to pursue the bandits up the old road to Boarshead Pass and, by any means necessary, retrieve the chalice. The posted reward is 40 gp, but Lughryd can be haggled up to 150 gp as his reputation and the good will of the lords who expect him to deliver the chalice is more valuable than the chalice itself. Note that, if pressed, Lughryd will agree to pay as much as 50 gp to PCs in advance, and may offer other assistance as well, such as mounts on loan, etc.

## Traveling to Boarshead Pass

The bandits will probably have a full day’s lead on any pursuers. PCs can trail the bandits with ease along the old trail to the pass, as they are not making any effort at hiding their trail, and are sticking to the old road in any case. After almost a full day (that is, eight hours) of travel (about 12 miles) the bandits will have made a camp in a clearing by a strongly flowing stream. It is here that they are attacked by a party of hobgoblins.

Pursuing PCs will almost certainly happen upon bandit camp and learn of the unfortunate fate of the two bandits. Both have been savagely killed. One is tied to a tree, the body hacked and missing arms and legs. The other bandit was clearly burned over a fire, and perhaps partly eaten. There is no sign of the chalice, or anything else of value. Those with _Local Kn__owledge_ of goblin kind will find clear signs that hobgoblins did these two men in and can determine that they headed northwest, following rough path that leaves the main trail north. It will not require the _Survival_ skill tracking ability to follow the trail.

The hobgoblins have traveled about 4 miles farther up the trail from the clearing. PCs following them will hear sounds of a fight when they reach the base of a low hill. The fight is in a small rocky outcrop on the side of the hill. The fight turns out to be a property dispute between a single ogre and four hobgoblins, and it is nearly over when PCs arrive on the scene. If PCs intervene, the ogre will grab the treasure sack and the chest with the chalice and attempt to head off up the hill and toward his lair, leaving the PCs and hobgoblins to do as they please. The hobgoblins, smarting from the ogre’s gentle attentions, may fight a small party of no more than four members, or may attempt to flee north and down the hill. If PCs do not intervene and in any case are undetected by the ogre and his hobgoblin antagonists, the fight will end in 2-3 rounds, the ogre will grab the loot and head for his lair, and the hobgoblins will yell at him, taunt him, and then confer for a bit before heading north along the trail.

Ideally, PCs will follow the ogre to his lair. He does, after all, obviously have the chalice. If they choose to do so, they can try to actually pursue and catch him before he gets home, or they can try to trail him at a discreet distance and learn where he beds down.

Should PCs follow the hobgoblins, they may try to pursue and catch up before the hobgoblins reach a rendezvous with nine more of their friends. If they continue after the hobgoblins have met up with their friends, they face a fight with an irritable band of thirteen.

## Ogre Cave Complex

**1.** **Entrance**

Read aloud: As you approach the end of the narrow path from the west, you see a large stone about 9 ft. tall leaning against the wall of rock to the left, with a gap about 3 – 4 ft. wide between the stone's lower half and the wall. A crude lattice of poles and branches wedged between the rock and the stone of the hillside blocks this gap, appearing to serve as a crude door.

This gap is the entrance to the cave. The crude branch door is meant to keep animals and such from wandering in, and to make stealthy entrance somewhat challenging. Once the lattice is removed, entry is not difficult, but anyone taller than 5 ft. will have to duck to go inside, and only small creatures will be able to enter more than one at a time. Moving the bramble is easy enough, and will only take about half a minute (5 rounds for a single character, and 3 rounds for two characters; no more than two characters can effectively help in the confined space. Anyone trying to remove bramble stealthily should make a Stealth check. If the ogre is in area 2, the DC is 20. If he is in area 3, it is DC 20. Stealth triples the amount of time to remove the branches. Roll d20 to determine the ogre's location:

1-4 He is in area 3.

5-8 He is in area 2.

9-20 Otherwise he is in area 4.

Past the doorway, the passage widens from 10 ft. wide and roughly 8 ft. high into the cavern. About 15 ft. north of the door, the ceiling sharply rises to a rough 10-12 ft. high.

**Trap** A crude tripwire trap causes rocks to fall on anyone in the 10’ x 10’ square just inside the entry, allowing several rocks to fall, 1-4 of the rocks possibly hitting PCs in the area affected (attack bonus +10, 1d4 damage each). The vine trip line for this trap is just over 10 ft. from the entrance to the cave, allowing a few people to enter before the first person encounters the trap. This trap is crude and anyone can detect it without searching before triggering it with a passive DC 15 Perception check. Anyone actively searching can detect the trap by searching for it with a DC of 10. Once detected, the trap can be disarmed by anyone with the skill with a DC of 15. Note that the noise of springing the trap will almost certainly alert the Ogre that intruders have entered (roll a DC 10 Perception check for the Ogre if the trap is sprung). If alerted to intrusion, the Ogre will attack aggressively.

**2. Entry Cavern**

Read aloud: You step out of the entryway into a cavern roughly 30 ft. square with a ceiling with a height varying from 12–16 ft. Some litter and debris lay scattered around—probably drifting in on wind or dragged in from the outside. To the northwest a low (5 ft. high) natural arch spans a 10 ft. wide opening with some rubble and debris cluttering it. To the west, about 25 ft. from the entryway, another arch about 7 ft. high leads west into darkness.

This cavern is a fairly unremarkable natural foyer to the complex, but is otherwise unremarkable except as noted below.

_**A. Rubble Filled Passage**_

Read aloud: A cave-in has choked this passage to the northeast with boulders and rubble. Many of the boulders are massive and impossible to move through normal means.

This part of the cavern has a ceiling around 10 ft. high. The cave-in happened years ago, and the passageway is otherwise stable. Some signs that there has been work on this part of the cavern can be discerned by anyone looking closely enough. Any PC looking over the area around the rubble can see some broken logs with a DC 15 perception check. A more detailed examination of the rubble, such as searching for anyway to pass it, may, with DC 20 perception checks, reveal tool marks on some rocks, and some pieces of broken wood fastened by pegs or chiseled. This will lead them to discover some looser and lighter rubble about 10 ft. into the passage, where the ceiling lowers to about 8 ft.

Anyone wanting to pass beyond the blockage can work to excavate a small tunnel in this area, in the top 3 ft. or so , where the looser and small rocks and loose gravel can be moved by hand or simple tools, and where there is a cavity starting after about 3 ft. or so from the western edge. The tunnel will take roughly half an hour to dig through and will only sufficient for one individual at a time to crawl through without significant armor or encumbrance. Items that will fit in a roughly 3 ft. diameter passage can be moved awkwardly in stages to move to the other side. Each move into or through the cleared passage counts as if it were 2 squares, and while squeezed in the narrow space, characters take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to AC. The tunnel as opened will slope slightly downward toward area 5. Note that the crawling character is prone while crawling through the tunnel, with the corresponding adjustments to attack rolls and armor class.

_**2B. Ramp**_

This naturally formed stone slope rises from the floor at the north end to about 15 ft. at the south end. It is an open cliff edge on the east side, but butts against solid stone on the west. The slope's width is 3-5 ft., so characters climbing it must be in single file. Only one character has room to work with the door to area 3. at the top. The door is a crude wooden door made of rough cut log poles bound with rope. It is hung on crude hide hinges attached to a vertical pole wedged into the rock opening, and is barred on the western side in area 3. The bar is not a complex locking mechanism, and unlocking the door requires only a DC 20 Disable Device check. There are metal scraps, cups, plates, etc. attached to the western face of the door to make noise if the bar is moved or the door is opened. A failure on the Disable Device check means that noise sufficient to wake the ogre.

**3****. Ogre’s Larder and Pantry**

Read aloud: As you push through the doorway, the smell of spoiled food, excrement, and other filth is the first thing you notice. Looking around, you see that you are in another cavern somewhat similar to area 2 in most respects. To the north are three wooden tripods from which large parts of some animal carcasses and some parts of a medium humanoid hang. Some barrels, casks, and a few crates are stacked to the north of the tripods. Along the west wall, a stone ramp rises up to a ledge that is about 9 ft. high, and it appears that a cavern continues beyond that ledge to the west. Sitting in the northwest corner, at the base of the ramp slope, is a very bedraggled and haggard looking hobgoblin, his hands and feet bound by straps of hide.

The hobgoblin prisoner, Ilsnaug – knows about the statues and the stone door and has secreted some modest treasure in some rocks at 6C. If freed, will guide his liberators to the edge of the chasm (6D.), indicating a possible crossing point at 6B (the remnants of an old bridge). He is a leader among the hobgoblin band that is coming to raid this lair, and can influence his fellows to allow anyone who treats him reasonably well to live, particularly if he is allowed to keep his treasure and belongings retrieved from 6C. Of course, the hobgoblins will keep any loot held by defeated adventurers, and the influence of this hobgoblin only goes so far. The same is true of his value as a hostage.

**5. Low Passage**

Read aloud: The ceiling in this passage is only 4 ft. high at the southern end, rising to about 6 ft. as it widens into the great cavern about 30 ft. to the northwest. Some of the rubble has tumbled into the passage.

Any character crawling out of the tunnel through the Rubble Filled Passage (area 2A.) will exit near the passage ceiling, about 1-2 ft. above the passage floor. To the southeast, about 8 ft. from the cleared entrance from the tunnel, is a skeleton in rotting leather armor in a recumbent position against the wall in the southeast corner.

Read aloud: A

  
  

_**6E. Bronze Warrior Statues**_

Read aloud: On the north wall you see a natural stone irregularly shaped archway 8-9 ft. high and nearly 25 ft. wide. Just inside the archway, on the east and west sides, are two bronze statues standing 6 ft. tall on pedestals about 1 foot tall. The statues are nearly identical armored warriors depicted in a sort of scaled armor and breastplate. Each statue is somewhat pitted and coated with verdigris. The immediate area around the arch has clearly been worked with tools. Behind the statues a flight of rough stone steps leads up and to the north and appears to end at a rough stone door or wall.

The statues are generally unremarkable ornaments. Close inspection of them, and some comparison, indicates they were likely cast as mirror-images of each other. The western statue has an ornamental axehead on its breastplate (it appears that the eastern statue might have had a similar fixture, but it is now missing, leaving only some broken bronze fastening points and a faint outline in the verdigris).

The remaining axehead is actually detachable if turned ¼ turn counter-clockwise and pulled. Anyone searching for traps, secret doors, etc. can discover this with a DC 15 Perception check (DC 10 if they specify an examination of the axehead itself). The axehead is mostly unremarkable. It weighs about 3 lb. and is roughly 5 in. x 9 in. It has a faint magical aura that can be detected by a Detect Magic spell or similar examination. This axehead is the key to the stone door at 6F., and has an intricately keyed protrusion that fastened it to the statue’s chest plate. This key will fit in a corresponding receptacle in the stone door at 6F.

_**6F. Great Stone Door**_

Read aloud: A flight of stone steps rises about 12 ft. over roughly 10 ft. laterally north to a landing 10 ft. x 10 ft. Set into the rough-hewn north wall is a great door of some soft of unpolished but smooth black stone. The door is 6 ft. wide and arched, the arch starting at 6 ft. and curving to an 8 ft. height at the center. There are runes engraved in an iron band that arcs just below the top edge of the door, and an iron pentagon plate in the center of the door, approximately 9 in. wide with some holes and a slot in an intricate pattern.

Anyone passing the statues and heading up the stairs will trigger a _Chill_ _M__etal_ spell focused on the metal fittings. This will cause a slight mist and some frost on the door. On the second round of the spell, the air grows noticeably chillier as well. The spell will only last for 2 rounds, will ice up the iron on the door, but will not harm anyone.

This door is 1 ft. thick and locked by strong iron bars 2 in. thick. Since it opens to the south on a hinge on its western side (hidden within the rock of the jamb), it is nearly impossible to force by a Strength ability check since there is no practical way to pull it, and pushing it would effectively require pushing stone into the stone jamb into which the door is set. The runes at the top are not magic, nor are they in any currently spoken language, but anyone with the linguistics skill may make a DC 30 check to decipher the gist of the message, and certain spells may also be of use:

“This is the tomb of the wizard T’Sothas Da’ahr. Intrude upon his final rest at great peril to your soul.” (Feel free to paraphrase depending on the success of the linguistics skill check.)

Anyone touching the door without using the key will trigger a _Ray of Frost_ spell trap unless a successful Perception roll discovers the trap at DC 25. Those with the trapfinding class feature can attempt to disable this trap with a DC of 25. Using the axehead key by inserting it properly into the pentagon receptacle, then turning the mechanism clockwise, will unlock the door with a distinct mechanical noise and sensation and bypass the trap.

After the door is opened, there will be a cloud of cold mist that slowly dissipates as explorers wait or head north up the stairs to area 9.

**7. Chamber of the Cauldron**

Read aloud: At the top of the stairs you reach the entrance to a wider area. As you approach the entryway just after the last step, four torches flare to full light ahead of you, illuminating a chamber about 30 ft. wide and 50 ft. long. The ceiling in the passageway is only 8 ft. high, but now it climbs to a rough and irregular 12 to 15 ft. The chamber is clearly natural stone, cut and chiseled to make a large room. In the center of this chamber the natural rock has been shaped into a large table. On the southern half of the table a large red cloth with a golden fringe covers something large and generally round in shape. Four small trees planted in large pots are set near the walls or in the corners of the room. A 10 ft. wide passage with an 8 ft. high ceiling exits from the center of the north wall.

This room is an antechamber to area 10. and the crypts beyond. On the west wall there is a large mural depicting a large battle scene in three panels. The mural's southern panel shows an army of orcs and other creatures in full melee against a battle line of armored and unarmored axe-wielding warriors. In the center of the line a large warrior in plate mail and helm is wielding a greataxe against a large ogre. Behind the warrior is a wizard firing a large bright bolt of magic from his staff into the swarming orcs. The center panel features the large helmed warrior—apparently a chieftain or captain of some sort—in more detail, standing in a golden chariot pulled by two horses. His helm is formed with the features of a great roaring bear's head, and he wears a large bearskin over his shoulders. The device on his breastplate is the silhouette of a bear on all four legs. Anyone examining the mural in detail may notice the depiction of a faint nimbus around the warrior (DC 10 Perception check). The third panel features the warrior and the wizard facing each other across a large flat stone table, the wizard gesturing toward a great cauldron between them, over which a glowing nimbus clearly shines. Some other vessels and implements are placed around the cauldron. In the background stand various people: some warriors, a few druids or priests in robes and other vestments, and various common farmers and craftspeople.

The four trees, one in the southwest corner, one in the middle of the east wall, and the remaining two in the northwest and northeast corners of the room, respectively, are apparently living holly trees (sacred to druids). While this is striking, it is not clear what sustains them, and they are otherwise ordinary trees with shiny green leaves and red and white berries. If any part of a tree is removed from this chamber, it will wither and crumble to dust in 1d4 minutes.

The table is about 15 ft. long, 10 ft. wide overall, but somewhat irregularly shaped. Under the red cloth is an iron cauldron with worked gold inlay on the outer sides and handles with two small gold dragons wrapped around them. There is a ladle to the south of the cauldron (also gold), and a large silver knife on the northern side. In the cauldron is an inky and oily liquid that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. Nevertheless, a faintly iridescent light emanates from the cauldron when it uncovered. Around the top edge of the table are various runes, symbols and scrolling patterns—traditional signs of arcane power, but not themselves magic.

The cauldron is enchanted as long as it remains on the table, as is the liquid inside it. It is a scrying device and anyone who drinks some of the liquid in the cauldron will become unconscious for 1d3 hours, during which that person will have a brief premonition of some possible near term event (GM discretion). If the unconscious character has any illness or injuries, they will be completely healed or cured. After regaining consciousness the character is stunned for 1 hour minus a number of minutes equal to their Constitution ability score modifier, after which they are staggered for the remainder of the hour, and then are fully recovered from the ordeal.

The ladle, knife, and especially the cauldron are all valuable. The silver knife is ornate and rare and also valuable. The liquid in the cauldron can be bottled safely and retain some resale value to those knowledgeable in magic items and substances.

The door to the north is a strongly iron bound stone door that pulls open to the south on hinges on the western side. The door is 8 ft. tall, 5 ft. wide and 6 in. thick. The hinge plates are riveted on the southern face of the door. The door is locked with a simple lock (DC 20 Disable Device check). There is a large pull ring on the eastern side of the door, which can be used to unlatch it and pull it open once it is unlocked. Forcing this door is next to impossible since pushing it will only force it into the frame, and the pull ring will break before the latches give. The door is otherwise unremarkable.

Undead, extraplanar and incorporeal evil creatures cannot enter this room. Evil creatures who enter will be be _nauseated_ and unable to attack or perform any actions other than a single move action per turn. The nausea will last for 1d6 rounds after leaving the room.

_**7A. Falling Block (Trap)**_

This trap is triggered by a pressure plate on a step in the middle of the stairs leading up and east to area 8. When triggered, a block of stone (area 7A.) about 10 ft. to the north of area 7 will begin to descend from its hidden position in the ceiling, taking 1 full round to fully descend to the rock floor. The block is a granite-type stone fitted to fill the passage, so is 8 ft. tall by 10 ft. wide, and is fully 2 ft. thick. It weighs approximately 26,879 lb.

Because of the full round (6 seconds) of time, it is feasible that one or more characters might try to wedge the block in its track using a dagger, handaxe, iron spike etc. Doing this is a DC 20 Dexterity check and a standard action. Characters can act if they succeed at a DC 15 Perception check to discern where the noise of the falling block originates and what it indicates. Ask those players what they intend to do (allow no discussion or input from players who did not make a successful Perception check), then start counting down from six to zero seconds. Indecisive players will not get to the block in time. Anyone who does and has a feasible action can try to stop the block from closing off the passage.

_**7**__**B. Wind,**_ _**Mist and Light**_

After the granite block seals the passage (or the six seconds pass in any case), another part of the trap is sprung. A _gust of wind_ blows from the east for a round, probably plunging adventurers without darkvision into darkness while it lasts. When the wind dies off, an _obscuring mist_ fills area 8. and four will-o-wisp _dancing lights_ originate from the east and begin making their erratic way toward anyone in the western end of area 8.

**8. Hall of the Skeletal Guardians**

Read aloud: As the spectral lights move forward and backward and dance around each other, you can hear something that sounds like metal scraping on stone. As the sound moves nearer, you can hear the tread of slow steps and make out faint shadows that look vaguely humanoid approaching with a shambling gait.

Six skeletons, somewhat illuminated in the mist by the dancing lights behind and around them, advance on the party. They are wearing deteriorated scale mail armor and wielding battleaxes. These _Skinned skeletons_ are a variant skeleton with a mummified layer of skin on them which has a resinous property that causes edged weapons to stick on low damage rolls (25% chance of sticking on rolls damage rolls of 1-2). If the weapon is stuck, a character may make a combat maneuver check as a standard action in the next round, without provoking an attack of opportunity, to dislodge the weapon and act normally. If the character fails to dislodge the weapon, it is lodged in the skeleton and cannot be used to attack until successfully dislodged. Naturally, the dismayed character may let go of the stuck weapon as a free action and draw a weapon as a move action (or as a free action with the Quick Draw feat).

These Skinned skeletons do not have DR 5/bludgeoning, so edged and piercing weapons do full damage. Their deteriorated scale mail armor only adds +2 to AC and has 10 hit points left in its broken condition. They have vulnerability to fire. The resin in their mummified skin makes them more susceptible to fire damage, and any fire-based hit requires the skeleton to make a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire. Such attacks include torches, and splash hits from flaming oil or alchemist's fire, and similar attacks. Any skeleton who catches fire takes 1d6 points of damage immediately and each round thereafter must make a DC 15 Reflex save or continue taking 1d6 points of damage.

Fighting the skeletons in the obscuring mist will be difficult—for both sides. Within 5 ft., opponents have concealment; beyond 5 ft. opponents have total concealment. Note that retreating down the stairs to the west will leave most of the mist behind. Creatures in the stairwell lose concealment, as the mist does not reach that far sufficiently to conceal them.

**9. Cold Warriors**

An irregularly shaped natural stone column roughly 12 to 15 ft. wide southwest to northeast extends from floor to the ceiling at about 9 ft. high in this location. Just beyond the column is an open space with two large chairs of cut black stone. Sitting in the chairs are two formidable and armored human skeletons. Beyond and between the two chairs is a large stone door set in an arch cut into the natural stone.

**Read aloud:** As you pass the rough stone column you hear a metalic scraping and the creak of bone and sinew as two armored skeletal figures rise from crude black stone chairs and turn to face you. A faint frosty mist surrounds them, and their scaled armor and the heads of their great axes are rimed with frost. A chill blue light gleams in their eyes as they stalk forward and raise their weapons. The air around you grows colder and your own breath steams as you ready yourselves to face these grim guardians.

Vulnerability to Fire You are vulnerable (+50% damage) to Fire damage.

The two throne-like chairs are made of unpolished dark black stone and are basically plain blocks carved into chairs with arms. The door on the southeast wall is similar to the one in area 9. It is iron bound stone and pulls open to the northeast. The door is 8 ft. tall, 5 ft. wide and 6 in. thick. It hinges on the northeast side, with the hinge plates mounted on the eastern face. The door is locked with a simple lock (DC 20 Disable Device check). A black iron pull ring on the eastern side of the door unlatches it and can be pulled to open the door (once it is unlocked). Forcing this door is next to impossible since pushing it will only force it into the frame, and the pull ring will break before the latches give. The door is otherwise unremarkable.

Beyond the door a natural stone passage slopes steeply downward (30-35 degree slope) to the east, curving to the north. The air is cool, moist and fresh. Anyone looking down the passage can make a DC 15 Perception check to notice reflection at the end of the passage (about 30 ft. away, and 20 ft. down) and discern that it might be from water or some other liquid. Descending down the passageway should not be difficult. There is a +2 DC modifier for Acrobatics checks, however.

**10. Retainer’s Tomb**

Read aloud:

The door to this tomb locked by an internal lock.

In this tomb lies T’Sothas Da’ahr's oldest and closest retainer and man-at-arms. His body is clad in a suit of half plate of unusual make and quality (but not magical or masterwork). A well-made longsword is held to the corpse's chest by now skeletal hands, but it shows little sign of corrosion. It is, however, not magical, just a well made and preserved weapon with a silver pommel in the shape of a roaring bear’s head. In the stone coffin are two porcelain jars, one containing 33 gp, the other five similar plain gold rings and two ornately carved armbands. Around the dead warrior's neck is a gold braided torc. Completing the contents of the coffin is a dessicated and crumbling leather pouch containing 51 sp.

**11. Apprentice’s Tomb**

Read aloud:

Like area 10, the stone door to this tomb is locked.

This is the tomb of a favored apprentice. Inside the sarcophagus lies the mummified remains of a wizard in a moldering robe. Resting on the skull is a golden circlet with a small gem set in the front. The apprentice's hands are crossed on his chest. In the right hand is a rod with an exceptionally clear blue quartz crystal set in its top, and, in the top third of the shaft, a symbol of a disk with lines radiating from it and a rampant bear in the center. On the apprentice’s left forefinger is a simple iron ring with an ornate raised symbol forged into it.

The rod is a magic key to T’Sothas Da’ahr's tomb door, and will also allow anyone bearing it to pass through area 14. without being attacked by the water elemental. It is otherwise a novel item of value. The ring is a key to a locked iron-bound wooden chest on the floor against the south wall of the crypt. Inserting the raised symbol into a corresponding socket will spring a latch and release the small door to the compartment. The chest contains a small bag with 12 gems worth 5 gp each, a dagger with a black antler hilt wrapped in silver wire and set with a garnet pommel worth 80 gp, 57 gp in coins in a well-oiled leather purse set with four garnets (purse is worth 15 gp; each gem is worth 3 gp), and three black lacquered leather scroll cases each containing ornate vellum scrolls.

One scroll has a Mage Armor spell, another an Obscuring Mist spell, and the last a Shield spell.

# Monsters

# Spells

_**Chill Metal**_

**S****chool** transmutation [cold]; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** metal equipment of one creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart; or 25 lbs. of metal/level, none of which can be more than 30 ft. away from any of the rest

**Duration** 7 rounds

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); Spell Resistance yes (object)

_Chill metal_ makes metal extremely cold. Unattended, nonmagical metal gets no saving throw. Magical metal is allowed a saving throw against the spell. An item in a creature’s possession uses the creature’s saving throw bonus unless its own is higher.

A creature takes cold damage if its equipment is chilled. It takes full damage if its armor, shield, or weapon is affected. The creature takes minimum damage (1 point or 2 points; see the table) if it’s not wearing or wielding such an item.

On the first round of the spell, the metal becomes chilly and uncomfortable to touch but deals no damage. The same effect also occurs on the last round of the spell’s duration. During the second

(and also the next-to-last) round, icy coldness causes pain and damage. In the third, fourth, and fifth rounds, the metal is freezing cold, and causes more damage, as shown on the table below.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
  
|_**Round**_|_**Metal Temperature**_|_**Damage**_|
|1|Cold|None|
|2|Icy|1d4 points|
|3-5|Freezing|2d4 points|
|6|Icy|1d4 points|
|7|Cold|None|

Any heat intense enough to damage the creature negates cold damage from the spell (and vice versa) on a point-for-point basis. Underwater, chill metal deals no damage, but ice immediately forms around the affected metal, making it float if unattended.

_Chill metal_ counters and dispels _heat metal_.

_**Dancing Lights**_

**School** evocation [light]; **Level** bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** Up to four lights, all within a 10-ft.-radius area

**Duration** 1 minute (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o’-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round.

A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell’s range.

You can only have one _dancing lights_ spell active at any one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. If you make this spell permanent, it does not count against this limit.

_Dancing lights_ can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

_**Obscuring Mist**_

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** cleric 1, druid 1, sorcerer/ wizard 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 20 ft.

**Effect** cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius from you, 20 ft. high

**Duration** 1 min./level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a gust of wind spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A fireball, flame strike, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell’s area. A wall of fire burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

_**Gust of Wind**_

**School** evocation [air]; **Level** druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** 60 ft.

**Effect** line-shaped gust of severe wind emanating out from you to the extreme of the range

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a –4 penalty on Fly skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 Fly skill check or be blown back 2d6 × 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 Fly skill check to move against the force of the wind.

A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 × 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.

Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind.

Medium or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check. Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect. This spell can’t move a creature beyond the limit of it’s range.

Any creature, regardless of size, takes a –4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a gust of wind.

The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.

In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.

Gust of wind can be made permanent with a permanency spell.

_**Ray of Frost**_

**School evocation** [cold]; Level sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

A ray of freezing air and ice projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to a target. The ray deals 1d3 points of cold damage.

# Boarshead Pass Treasure

Based on a per-encounter reward of 350 gp baseline, the total value of rewards for the Axefall Pass adventure approximately 3,500 gp for the party.

That works out to approximately 583 gp per party member for a party of six PCs. For eight PCs, it would be 438 gp for each party member, and for four PCs, it would be 876 gp each.

The encounters upon which the rewards are based are listed below, with their commensurate value. Note that the actual rewards—i.e., treasure—will not necessarily be associated directly with the encounter. To a reasonable extent, encounters without significant treasure will be balanced by encounters or areas with more significant treasure.
