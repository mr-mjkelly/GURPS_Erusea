[[Goruk the Goblin Shaman]] has charmed a young scion of a local merchant guildmaster. This is because the guildmaster promised to deliver a bridesgift for [[Goruk the Goblin Shaman|Goruk]]'s umpteenth daughter. However, both the young [[Goblins|goblin]] groom-to-be and the gift have vanished.

1. The brigands of [[Cragsmere Keep]] have abducted the [[Goblins|goblin]] groom-to-be and taken the gift. Unbeknownst to [[Goruk the Goblin Shaman|Goruk]] or the guildmaster.
2. [[Goruk the Goblin Shaman|Goruk]] has threatened to transform the merchant guildmaster's son into a goblin and marry him into one of the nearby tribes if the treasure and goblin fianc√© are not returned by some deadline day/time. The threat is not idle.
3. The merchant guildmaster, who has done nothing wrong, is not pleased at all, and has done everything from begging [[Goruk the Goblin Shaman|Goruk]] for mercy to calling for the the eradication of the [[Goblins|goblin]] race.
4. In lieu of raising an expensive mercenary army of [[Goblins|goblin]] exterminators, the guildmaster might enlist the aid of a party of PC adventurers.
5. If the PCs manage to figure out that the [[Cragsmere Keep]] brigands are culpable, they may be able to broker a peace between [[Goruk the Goblin Shaman|Goruk]] and the guildmaster.
6. This situation (scenario) presents some interesting elements, not the least of which is the concept of [[Goblins|goblins]] as more non-player characters than monster. This is a tenet of my milieu concept--thinking beings as subjects rather than objects. There is also some dramatic opportunity for ***ROLEPLAYING*** in this early adventure, which provides a means for PCs of non-martial type, even at low levels, to contribute to the adventure in more than just a support or backup capacity.
