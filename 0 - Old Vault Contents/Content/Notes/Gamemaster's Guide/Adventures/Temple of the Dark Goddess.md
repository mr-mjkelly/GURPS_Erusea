# Overview

A disturbed priestess of a goddess with multiple aspects went mad when a few locals raped her sister. She applied some dark knowledge of her religion and set herself up in an ancient, abandoned temple a day’s travel from the town. There, with some novices, male acolytes, and guards, she prepared for and carried out a ritual to summon a dark agent of her goddess, to avenge herself on those she perceives as her enemies. The goddess answers by changing the priestess into a demon-like harpy (a good basis for stats, by the way) at night, and she has spent the last month prowling the villages, flying in and making off with selected victims. She has been particularly hard on men, and even some soldiers and warriors have fallen prey to her rampage.

The high priestess of the goddess’ legitimate temple is in need of some help. For political reasons, she cannot turn to the town or other orders for help. She and her inner circle of trusted priestesses know what is happening (priestesses can do these things…) and they know what is necessary to stop the rampage.

I am thinking that it will be water from a particular well font. Those seeking the font must carry a specially prepared vessel to the site of the magic well. This site should be a minor underground complex—a very ancient (and primitive) series of vaulted chambers and passages used for ancient devotions to some almost forgotten deity. This temple will have guardians, but not the mortal kind. It will also have a few traps…

An assistant to the high priestess will make contact with any adventurers interested in helping through an intermediary guard. The assistant will offer a reward, but she will caution against looting temples, and will ask to examine any items taken from the dark priestess’ temple.

The first step, then, is to get things started. I think it is a good idea to have characters already in town for a few days before the adventure begins. That will allow for a reading of a pre-written background. After the reading, players will have some idea what their characters know. From there, I can tailor some special knowledge based on PC backgrounds. For example, fighters might hear rumors about the attacks from other soldiers and warriors; mages and similar spell-casters might have some insights from their various lore skills, and from their professional backgrounds; clerics might have insights into rumors about the Temple of the Goddess. Under no circumstances should anyone be able to infer the precise nature of the problem. Even after the high priestess recruits a party to deal with the dark priestess, she will not suggest that the adversary was once one of her order.

The next step is for an agent of the high priestess to make contact with mercenary adventurers. This agent will be one of her close friends, although a warrior who guards the temple will make the first contact, and then introduce the priestess.

The priestess’ yarn should be somewhat pre-scripted; PC Q&A will require some flexibility, and some quick thinking to avoid giving too much away (while still giving subtle slips and hints).

After they are hired, PCs will learn from the priestess that the roaming menace is a cursed creature that must drink daily at a certain altar to survive, and give them general directions to the temple (at which point they are on their own to infiltrate it and secretly put the blessed water in the altar font).

The temple guard will tell PCs to rendezvous somewhere after they retrieve their gear from wherever they are staying, and purchase whatever else they need. The rendezvous location will be far from the temple, so as not to arouse more suspicion. There the temple priestess who hired them will give one of the PCs a special vial—one magically strengthened and specially blessed for the occasion. Only water from the well, carried in this vessel, will work to break the curse on the dark priestess.

The trip to the first dungeon—the temple with the well—will be relatively uneventful. Members of the cult, along with some hired brigands, will attack the party on the third night out.

The dungeon itself will take about a day to fully explore. Unless something untoward happens, there will not be an overnight stay. Traps and tricks provide some security for the shrine. Deeper treasuries—should PCs be adventurous (or greedy) enough to venture farther into the catacombs than they need—have guardians too: some formidable regenerating mummies and some kind of wight in ancient armor.

Consider bringing PCs into the game via an initial plea for help from a nearby village. Make this meeting with the forces of evil a clue carrier…

# History of the Shrine

A persecuted people in the period of the Kurtai invasions from far away east hid several of their most sacred relics in this shrine, and perhaps practiced their deepest mysteries here as well. As the Kurtai established permanent settlements, the native tribes retreated into the inland wilderness, and their resistance stiffened. The Kurtai priests and warlords concentrated on capturing and killing the priestesses and druids of the ancient native religion, defiling groves, temples, and shrines as they crushed tribal resistance.

Throughout this period, now long past (but not forgotten), this particular shrine remained hidden and protected from the Kurtai devastation. While it was not a place of worship, its existence was a symbol of the power of the triune Goddess, whose warrior aspect was most prominent in the struggle against invading warlords. The sanctuary of the well was thought to have mystical and oracular powers, as well as to be a place of great healing to the heroic warriors (male and female) of the tribes. Legend holds that many of the greatest tribal heroes, including one of the seven chieftains, were entombed in the shrine complex, guarded by the shades of their loyal household warriors, with their weapons close to hand for their journey into the next world.

## Notes

The shrine does indeed hold the body of several tribal heroes, and one of the legendary chieftains. This particular chieftain had a powerful torc that reputedly inspired men to great deeds, and to protect its wearer from dark magic. This particular item was lost in the chieftain’s last battle, and is hidden far from this site. However, a scroll concerning the final disposition of the torc is hidden in the chieftain’s crypt, in a vault below his mummified body. Those who defile the crypt, however, do so at their peril. A vicious trap protects the chieftains crypt, and the guardian warriors (skeletal undead) guard the cavern catacombs. The shade of the chieftain is bound to the crypt, and will rise to defend the remains and the secret therein. Only someone who possesses the seal of a priestess, has been blessed with water from the shrine’s holy well, and is sincerely on a quest to help the native tribes, will be tolerated by the shade. In this particular adventure, the shade will at best reject an altruistic intruder; he will attack treasure hunters.

## Encounter Areas

### 1. Entry Passage and Long Stair

The entry is a low (5’ tall at the peak), narrow opening cluttered with roots and cobwebs. A cool, moist draft blows out. The first 30’ of the passage is irregular and narrow, requiring tall characters to stoop, and for people to walk single file until it widens and the ceiling begins to rise (to a variable height 20’ to 40’ above the bridge). The passage turns east and a long flight of stairs leads down and out of sight as they curve to the west. After about 20’ laterally, and about 15’ vertical descent, the ceiling height rises out of sight and the stairs open on the right (eastern) side, becoming a sharp cliff edge that drops off into darkness below. The long stair levels off at the a point 40’ below the entrance, next to the Chain Bridge, and then continues descending precipitously northward for another 30’ laterally to 60’ below the entrance. The path along the cliff continues to a dead end. It is slippery and, at its narrowest point, requires an Easy moving maneuver to pass safely without slipping and possibly falling. Agility stat bonuses or skills like climbing will aid the maneuver. A fall result on the Moving Maneuver table causes the unfortunate to fall and suffer a Fall/Crush attack with critical results one degree lower than the result rolled (due to the water at the bottom). Those surviving the fall will find themselves in deep water in the pool below. Note that “falling” does not necessarily mean going over the edge; use the critical results judiciously to determine the actual effects of a failed maneuver.

### 2. The Chain Bridge

Both spans of this two-part bridge are strong enough to hold a combined weight of 300 lbs. with ease. Great iron links nearly 6” long and 1” thick form two parallel chains that suspend, on slightly smaller links, wooden planks 2’ wide. The planks are rotten and will likely break if anyone puts significant weight on them. The chains are rusty, and covered with condensation and grime, but they sound, and anyone succeeding at a Medium moving maneuver (with applicable skill and stat bonuses) can cross successfully by stepping on the smaller links that hold the planks (or remnants thereof). Those failing the maneuver may fall (depending on the maneuver result) ending up in the deep pool below. Damage will be limited to A critical results on the Krush critical table, and seldom lethal. Of course, the pool is deep, dark, and has perils of its own.

### 3. Sloping Passage

The bridge crosses to a natural chamber with a ceiling about 30’ to 40’ high. Short stalactites hang from the ceiling, and a few mineral deposits run down the walls. The passage is generally easy to negotiate. A short flight of natural steps augmented by human work leads down to a long slope to the next chamber 90’ below the entry level. From that point, the passage opens up to another cliff on the west side.

A. Pit Trap: A counter-weighted trap door will spring open if more than 50lbs. is placed on it. The trap was well-made, but age has damaged its disguise, and it is now detectable with a Medium static maneuver if anyone is searching that part of the floor for traps. Otherwise, it is Extremely Hard to detect by observation during normal passage. The trap will drop its victim into a steep chute. The chute’s outlet is 25’ above the surface of the deep pool. The trip through the chute and the drop to the water below will cause normal damage on the Fall/Krush table, with a maximum critical result of A.

### 4. Large Cavern

This natural cavern has a high ceiling that is similar to the rest of the greater cavern around the great pool; it is 80’ to 120’ above the shoreline of the pool at this point. Aside from the natural features, the cavern is not particularly notable. Anyone exploring the water will notice some pale fish ranging from a few inches to, very occasionally, almost a foot in length. The fish are harmless, although they will nibble toes, and are edible. Those who venture up the terrace to the highest level of this cavern will discover some old, rotting baggage and bedding, and the remains of a campfire.

A. Old Campsite: A short examination of the two bedrolls, rucksacks, and small campfire will indicate that this may have been the camp of a couple of adventurers exploring the shrine. There is little of value in the gear, which is mostly moldy and in a state of advanced deterioration. Deeply buried in one pack, and detectable only if the contents are specifically and thoroughly searched, is a sack with 20g.p., 150s.p., a small gold idol worth around 50g.p., and five amethysts worth 5g.p. each. In a bundle between the bedrolls are 25 crossbow quarrels, which are usable, 9 iron spikes, and 2 50’ silk ropes which are dirty but serviceable. In a nook at the head of the bedrolls are 15 torches, 6 flasks of lantern oil, and a hooded lantern in reasonable condition. There are also some rations and cooking ware, but the rations are partially eaten by vermin and long rotten. In the pillow of the southernmost bedroll is a small book—a journal kept by one of the explorers. This book is small, and can only be found if the pillow is searched specifically. Not much of it is intact or legible (see below).

The Journal:

…crossed the pool bridge…

…the great doors…warning sounded…danger…

…bridge over the chasm…

Explored the cavern around the chasm…

…could not open the…tombs

### 5. Great Pool

This large underground pond is a deep pool (from about 20’ to 60’ deep, indicated by underwater contours) with outlets well below the waterline, somewhere along the southwest wall. In recent years, the water in the complex has risen, and the pool is deeper than it used to be. The site of an old bridge (A.) is now underwater on both sides, but what used to be dry ledge to and from the bridge is also underwater, but is only 3’ to 4’ deep. There is a very slight current from north to south where the waterfall cascades noisily from 20’ above the waterline. There are three natural columns near the Chain Bridge, one of which acts as a landing between the two sections of the bridge.

### 6. Great Door

A flight of stone steps leads up out of the water to a set of double stone doors. The doors are 4’ wide and 8’ tall, with slightly arched tops. They are each 1’ thick. Heavy bronze bands and fittings reinforce the stone. The doors open to the east, on heavy bronze hinges (3 on each door) set on the north and south sides. Two great bronze rings, hang from the noses of crude relief sculptures of white bulls centered on each door. In a circle around the relief an inscription reads, “Beyond is the Shrine of the Great Mother. All Who Enter are Her Children.” Only someone skilled in the ancient language of the priestesses (no longer in use, even in the temples) will be able to read the runes. The north door is slightly (about one foot) ajar.

### 7. The Smaller Chain Bridge

A smaller version of its cousin in the great cavern, this bridge has an 80% chance of collapsing if it bears more than 150lbs. If it parts, anyone on it can make a maneuver roll to grab and hold part of the chain, saving them from a fall to certain death in the nearly bottomless (240’ deep) chasm below. The Quickness stat bonus, modified by Armor Quickness Penalties, and other appropriate skills or abilities modify the maneuver. Even those managing to hold onto the chain will drop for quite a ways, suffering damage on the Fall/Krush table. Which side of the chasm falling victims end up on is up to the GM.
