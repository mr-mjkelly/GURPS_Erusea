# Background

## The kingdom of Aberlun

In the nearly three centuries since the reign of the last Danaran High King, the realms of the Kialti people have contracted and diminished, many falling into barbarism or failing utterly. The realm of Aberlun, once a member of the greater High Kingdom, is the largest of the remaining Kialti realms. The king sits uneasily on his throne. Much of his realm is wilderness, and many of his subjects live in isolated settlements surrounded by leagues of unsettled or abandoned land. Barbarian tribes of Aelsh and Iscendi have grown in number and strength in these regions, and their raids threaten to destabilize the eastern borderlands. Lawless bands roam the countryside, pillaging and looting at will. From the north, incursions of orcs, hobgoblins and their greater kindred are increasing. Aldrans are pressing their claim in the southern marches. Some of the Aberlan lords are disobedient and unruly, even outright rebellious. Some of the noble families have intermarried with Aldran noble houses. A few of these families hold strong castles in important locations, and their potentially divided loyalties are a concern.

## Adventure scenario

Balderc, an Aldran brigand has learned of a legendary carved skull of pure black onyx that purportedly has the power to control a powerful demon and to raise the dead. He has sought this stone for nearly a year, intending to use it against various enemies and rivals and to set himself up as a petty lord. His search led him to the vicinity of Kinnivar, to a temple of the goddesses and a shrine to Cerridwen. He and his band raid the temple complex, killing two guards and torturing priestesses until he learns the location of the onyx skull in the secret vaults of the reliquary. Balderc also learns that the skull alone is useless, and must be set in a special rod and used in a special ritual to summon the demon. When he reads the scrolls and leather bound journal he found beneath the shrine, he learns about the ruins of the old keep and their dark history.
