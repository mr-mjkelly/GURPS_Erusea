# Introduction

# The Setting

Galthwyn is a small holding in the “borderlands” to the northeast of the kingdom of Ambria. Not far to the northeast and northwest is wilderness, and the remnants of older human or demi-human holdings. Non-human races and several barbarian tribes inhabit the wilderness. Only hardy civilized folk dwell in these lands.

The Galthwyn estate was settled only three generations ago. The first Lord Galthwyn, Boras, received his grant of land as a reward for his courage and loyalty in battle. He settled it with his family and a small war band. It was wild land, but fertile and good for hunting. The nearby temple served as a base of operations for House Galthwyn until the keep could be built.

# The Background Gist

It has been more than fifteen years since Lord Hiras Galthwyn answered a call to arms and headed west to march with his baron in an extended campaign against the Argaeldi along the border.

In his stead his elder son Giles ran the estate. Giles’ sister Mila helped as she could while caring for their ailing mother, Aelda Galthwyn. Aelda’s illness was terminal. When a man named Calas Vedrek who claimed to be a healer came to the manor, he convinced young Siras Galthwyn, the youngest of the Galthwyn line, to let him attend to Aelda.

To all appearances, Aelda seemed to get better, but slowly. Vedrek gradually became a fixture at the manor, making friends with commoners and members of the household alike with an almost unnatural charm. In truth, Vedrek is a sorcerer who is planning to become a minor lord in his own right. He hopes to insinuate himself into the Galthwyn household and become its true master. To that end, he is prolonging Aelda’s life, at the expense of her soul, and charming the young and impressionable Siras.

Over the period of one or two years, Vedrek corrupted Siras, and even convinced him that his brother and sister were responsible for Aelda’s illness. By the time Giles was knighted and the family received news that Lord Hiras had been killed in battler, Siras was entirely under Vedrek’s influence. Vedrek also gained the alliance of several men, including some of House Galthwyn’s men-at-arms. It was not long before Giles and Mila had to flee the keep and young Silas became the new lord of Galthwyn.

The manor and the lands around it deteriorated. A few common folk were forced to stay on the estate’s demesne to serve and provide for the manor proper. Nearby villages and freeholds were abandoned as people left for better places.

Vedrek continues to corrupt Siras, using a special dark book to transform him in stages into a werewolf. Aelda, once Lady Galthwyn, passes into undeath and her shade is relegated to dungeons beneath the keep along with some of the household loyal to her.[1](#sdfootnote1sym) Siras is a tyrant by day, subject to the manipulations of Vedrek. Using men-at-arms as brigands in the livery of house Galthwyn, they rule the surrounding area with an iron fist.

Over the years, Giles and Mila have not been entirely idle. They are in exile, living in the forest, working with some loyal fighters to resist their usurper brother and the sorcerer who stole their lands and home.

# Adventure Sites and Encounter Areas

## The Manor Keep and Dungeons

The keep is an operational, albeit hostile, stronghold for what remains of House Galthwyn. Below it is a dungeon complex (which might also serve as a possible covert entry route for clever PCs).

## Vedrek’s Secret Stronghold

Vedrek does not solely rely on Silas’ hospitality for his security. He has his own loyal retainers and unnatural guardians for his closest secrets and treasures. An old catacomb complex—classic dungeon crawl.

## Brigands

This is a group of actual brigands who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in the area. Their leader works closely with Vedrek who uses them to induce fear in the commoners and others in the region, ensuring some will seek the protection of even a tyrant like Siras. Dealing with these outlaws might be an initial sub-adventure for PCs when they first arrive in the area.

## The Resistance

Headquartered in a forest location, perhaps an old shrine and cave complex.

## The Temple/Monastery

A location that is still sacred to the locals and held by some reasonable powerful priestesses with some guards as well. The abbess and her people often aid Giles and Mila in their resistance, and are a thorn in Siras and Vedrek’s feet. This location is also a good place for PCs to rest and heal, particularly if they need special relief from serious wounds or some other form of harm from Vedrek’s magic.

# Adventure Flow

## Roadside Tavern

A small tavern consisting of a recently adapted granary building built at the intersection of the nearby roads. Crude furniture, tables with benches. No bar, but another table and a rack of kegs, tapped and untapped. Pewter mugs. Food is minimal—some cheeses, brown bread, etc. Local field workers can get two pints of drink (mead and ale mostly, of decent quality and freshness) along with a hunk of bread and some cheese. They must pay for more. Outsiders must pay standard rural prices. The temple brewery has supplied most of the drink and provides some gratis for those who till and toil in the local area.

PCs may be already drinking or newly arrived. The mood in the tavern is subdued but not grim. Strangers are not the only travelers and are not treated badly, but neither are they warmly engaged, even by the tavern keeper and his young stripling table boy. The crowd includes some farmers, (male and female), some men-at-arms (from the temple), a pair of older men, the miller, and a few travelers. If any PCs care to ask, the tavern old-timers (a couple of graybeards seated in a corner by a brazier, in two of the very few chairs in the establishment) will tell the woes. They will speak about the recent attacks by a group of brigands, and of course will regale any willing audience with the tale of the Beast of Galthwyn Manor (earning some frowns and grumbling from the taverner and others in the room).[2](#sdfootnote2sym)

PCs can buy lodging in a loft and a small meal from a nearby farmstead.

_**Brigand spy:**_ One of the patrons of the tavern from a nearby village will slip out at some point and head to a place where he can leave a message for brigands.

## Night Attack

A woodside hamlet about three or four miles away is attacked by some sort of creature. A young boy is killed. The next day villagers offer PCs money for the head of the beast. The tavern elders suggest that PCs might look into doings at the manor keep. The bereaved father of the slain boy suggests that PCs accompany him and those bringing his son’s body to the temple, and the brewer/driver who brought the beer and bread from the temple will reinforce this idea.

If the PCs decide to go to the temple, they can get more information and background from the High Priestess and others. In fact, and the brewer/driver will offer to bring them there if they seem inclined to hunt for the beast.

The driver is an agent working for Giles and Mila Galthwyn’s resistance group and will send or bring information to them regarding the PCs—good or bad.[3](#sdfootnote3sym)

## A Night at the Temple

This is a safe place for PCs. A true fortress guarded by a few well-trained and dedicated warriors and warded by the power of clerics (a high priestess, some bard-priests, and, in a nearby grove, a druid). Only evil or chaotic characters who break certain rules and violate hospitality will suffer here, and even that will usually only amount to ejection from the premises.

For the most part, this is an introduction to the temple as a place of refuge and healing. (It is also a possible origin point for party clerics, druids, paladins, and monks…) There is an adventure hook: an old shrine in the wooded hills to the northeast has an item that the High Priestess would like discreetly retrieved. She is willing to bless the quest, provide some helpful items (healing potions, scrolls…), and to pay. She mentions the only treasures she wishes brought to her, tacitly conceding the other loot to PCs.

## Quest to the Shrine

The High Priestess will ask and even try to persuade PCs to journey into the hills, brave the hazards of the wilds (orcs and such) on the way there, intrude on the barrows of long dead kings, find an ancient tomb and retrieve two ancient torcs that were hidden there by an evil sorcerer-priest.

PCs will be encouraged to bring the torcs back to the temple (in exchange for a reward or assistance and succor). Naturally other items in the tomb are fair game for “salvage” by PCs.

After they return with the torcs, and have some time (recovery, etc.) they will be asked whether they would be willing to help a cleric or two bring the torcs and some other items to a ruined shrine hidden farther into the hills and woods.

The High Priestess will provide the party with directions and maybe a rough map to the tomb, and give some basic hints about how to enter it. She will also provide some of the background to the tomb—an opportunity for a sagely type in the party to do some research of scrolls in the temple (role play that if feasible; avoid an expositional narrative).

### The Way There

This branch of the adventure should mostly be a wilderness adventure to a hidden shrine in a secluded natural setting with some wards that keep the orcs out. On the way there, orcs, ogres, goblins (and hobgoblins and bugbears), worgs, wolves, a bear, and other dangers will need to be dealt with in some manner.

### The Orc Band

A band of several orcs, an ogre, are likely to pick up the trail of PCs and dog them, waiting for an opportunity to ambush them.

### The Orc/Ogre Strongholds

This place needs to be cleaned out eventually. It is an area that includes an old ruined hill fort keep, a long abandoned watch tower, and some caves.

### The Barrow Hills

The shrine should be located such that PCs have to travel through some barrows hills with some undead and treasure. Ideally PCs move through it during daylight, or attempt to, but get disoriented (for some strange reason…) and delayed until the sun goes down—and some mist forms in the valley.

### The Ancient Tomb

Major enemy? A mummy of some sort, but not the Egyptian sort—more like a dessicated corpse. Perhaps modify it so that it reconstitutes as a less powerful version unless destroyed by a cleric, magic, or is completely burned.

### The Shrine (and surrounding area)

The shrine was cursed years ago and the curse has left several undead guardians to haunt its passages and chambers and keep the druids and priests from the wealth and relics within. In fact, the former curator of those relics is now their chief guardian.

There are other creatures and dangers in the temple. Some wild monsters have come in over time. A few traps guard the most important treasuries.

The challenge is to explore the outer areas of the temple, which are hazardous and home to a few creatures. There is a persistent and opportunistic Orc leader as well, who may be waiting for PCs outside the ruins, and is likely to pursue them into the complex. Deep inside the shrine, guarded by holy magic and clever locks and wards, is the sanctum with the pool and altar.

It is in this inner sanctum where things get marvelous. There is an apparition representing the higher powers. If the Orcs invade this sanctum and defile the sanctum, the guardian apparition fires a wave of fiery light that passes over PCs and Orcs alike, but only feels uncomfortably warm to PCs, but immolates some of the Orcs and damages others. At some point I want the party teleported to an altar chamber of some sort on a nearby lake island. They can exit that location and leave the island, thus bypassing any Orcs who might be waiting to ambush them. Navigation back to the temple should not be too difficult.

---

This branch of adventures should lead PCs to accept the quest to return the three torcs and the chalice to the temple and earn the respect and good will of the temple and good folk in the surrounding area. They will be given various helpful items (potions, scrolls, etc.) from the High Priestess, perhaps loaned a baggage pony or mule, and some directions and landmarks (no detailed map!). After this series, PCs will be of interest to Mila and Giles Galthwyn, which should provide a lead into the next series of encounters and ultimately lead to a climax in the dungeons beneath Galthwyn manor and perhaps the conclusion in Verek’s stronghold.

## Traveling the Forest Road

Galthwyn keep should be about two days’ (and two nights’) journey along the road (well, track) to the north and west. The track cuts around some hills, and goes through a wooded vale for most of the journey.

If PCs choose to head off directly to the keep on the hunt for the beast, they will encounter the brigands on the road on the second night. Not all of them, but a roaming band or two. Depending on how the encounters work out, PCs may be ambushed or they may be the ambushers.

On the following day, in a woodland area, the resistance will try to capture them for interrogation if it does not seem that PCs are heading to the brigand stronghold.

## Raid on the Brigand Stronghold

This is a fairly straightforward bandit lair in a very ruined old shell keep and some cellar dungeons beneath it. All told, there are about a dozen bandits in the band, but some will have been encountered en route to the stronghold, and others may not be present at the lair when PCs find it and raid it. The brigand leader has some background information on Vedrek and the keep, including some knowledge of a secret entrance.

There is a decent amount of treasure held here.[4](#sdfootnote4sym)

One of the brigands is working with Giles and Mila and will lead PCs to a meeting with them—perhaps in the form of an ambush. PCs will be taken to meet with Giles and Mila and perhaps plan to assault Galthwyn Keep.[5](#sdfootnote5sym)

The raid on the stronghold and subsequent meeting with Galthwyn’s rebellious heirs will conclude this branch of adventure. The encounters should be sufficient to bring PCs to 2nd level, and some treasure should be of use in the assault on Galthwyn Manor and the following pursuit of the sorcerer Vedrek.

# Notes

Ambrian lords are not feudal lords. They are granted lands by their kings, but the borders of such lands are often imprecise and subject to frequent disputes. Common folk are generally not subjects of these lords. Some are tenant farmers who work the land and pay rent and taxes. Others are freehold farmers or craftsman who commit to certain services in exchange for being allowed to hold land and prosper from it. This service is often military, and such farmers form the yeoman soldiers of a local army.

There are slaves in Ambrian society, but normally these are prisoners of war or criminals and most are only serving for a set period of time.
