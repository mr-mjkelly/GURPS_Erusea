# Scenario

Two minor fiefdoms in the Kialti Kingdoms with a lot of wilderness in and among their settled parts. In one fiefdom, a fell beast ravages the forested hills. In the other, a large band of brigands, led by an armored “dark knight” with magical powers, is wreaking havoc.

The PCs should start dealing with the bandits or the beast, depending on which pleas for help they answer, and for what reward.

The brigands are in fact working for an agent of a sorcerer who has an interest in unsettling both of the fiefdoms. This sorcerer wants to establish a realm of his own, primarily because of the ancient ruins in the wild forest north of them—which was once a temple in some ancient period, and later became the stronghold of a long and almost forgotten sorcerer of great power. The “dark knight” is loyal to the sorcerer, and has some magic items, but is not a spell user in his own right.

In the other fiefdom, the beast is a creature conjured by the sorcerer. He calls it a Beast—a vaguely wolfish creature about 8’ tall when on two legs, but with scaly armor in various otherwise vital areas. A fast runner, with keen senses and extraordinary climbing ability, and very sharp teeth and claws, the Beast eschew weapons even though they have the dexterity to use implements.

The Beast is under the direction (but not quite the control) of a priest who works for the sorcerer. The sorcerer likes using priests from this particular sect because they are devoutly obedient; and apprentice might be a bit too independent at a distance.

The sorcerer is trying to use intrigue to weaken the order of the fiefdoms. He has sent some of the brigands, in the guise of monster hunters, to collect gold from the lord whose fief is being harried by the Beast. The gold is payment to hunt the beast. In fact, the sorcerer’s agents are using it partly to finance some operations, but mainly to allow some of it to be found at the scene of grisly crimes, including the abduction of a knight’s daughter, thus implicating the unwitting lord in crimes against his neighbor.

# Plotting

Start PCs either hunting the beast or dealing with the brigands.

They should find some clues that there are more to the brigands than simple raiding and pillaging—items, documents, etc.

It is probably best that the PC adventurers track down the brigands first. That adventure is most conducive to forming a party of previously unacquainted adventurer seekers of various professions. The motivation for the adventure will vary among the PCs. A few ideas:

1. There is a substantial reward for capturing or killing the brigands, particularly their leader. This will attract the more mercenary characters.
    
2. Rumors that the brigand leader is a demon spirit leads to discussion of the ruins of the old temple, and the mysteries and possible treasures still hidden there.
    

If they hunt the Beast, they should somehow have a chance to encounter the cleric. His presence alone should be a clue. Other clues might be items that indicate a connection to the brigand leader, or to the brigands generally (distinctive items in the clerics redoubt, etc.).

A helper NPC, who may also prove to be a red herring, is a reclusive ranger who is also a werewolf. He is, not surprisingly, reticent to admit that he is a werewolf, and he is good at controlling his transformations and his actions in his wolfish form. However, rumors that he is one persist, and he chooses to dwell in a remote forest cabin far from other human habitations. In his changed form, he might be a powerful antagonist to the Beast…

## Dun Lundyr

Dun Lundyr is the principal town in County Lundyr. Like most Kialti settlements, the town is not fortified. Only the count’s hall is fortified. In Lundyr’s case, the fort is a hall atop a motte hill. There is no curtain wall, but the hall itself is a stone keep with walls up to 5’ thick.

## The Keep [Map 2]

1. The Gatehouse
    
2. A two story stone gatehouse flanked by two three story round towers. Both the gatehouse and the towers have flat timber roofs, and both have machicolations. A 12’ high drawbridge provides access across the 12’-15’ deep dry moat. A strong wooden portcullis and a set of iron reinforced double doors nearly 18” thick provide additional security, as do several murder holes in the ceiling over the entry passage.
