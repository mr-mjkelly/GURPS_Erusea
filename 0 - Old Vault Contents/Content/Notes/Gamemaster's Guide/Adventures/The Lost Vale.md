# Background

More than a century ago, Taer Lundryn was the seat of a Danaran noble family, but now it is an abandoned ruin, occupied by a tribe of goblins and other creatures. The last of the Lundryn family answered his liege’s calling to defend the northern frontier against an incursion of giants and their allies, bringing with him the bulk of his household guard and many knights and yeoman who answered the muster. His wife and young children were sent away south. The war went badly in this region, and armies of the giant lords marched deep into these lands, raiding, pillaging, and sacking as they willed. The fate of the Lundryns and their people is unknown.

The current occupants of Taer Lundryn know little of its history and care less. The Goblin

## Read aloud to players:

```
The blinding flash of lightning is followed instantly by peals of thunder in a rumble booming from hill to hill. The storm is right on top of you. Your feet touch the rocky bottom and you slog your way to the dark tree-lined shore, unsure whether to curse the rain or thank the Gods for the concealment it offers. The wind and rain masked your downstream flight from the raid. The dark clouds made the night even darker. Orc folk can see in the dark, but the lightning unnerves their foul kind; even their greater cousins, the hobgoblins, are wary of the noise and light, their vision impaired by the searing brightness and their hearts quailing at the wrath of gods not their own.

As you and your companions reach the muddy bank and quickly scramble inland, you turn and look back upriver. Lightning flashes again, and in the sudden brightness you make out the wreck of the small boat that bore you down the swollen river, away from the orcs and hobgoblins who raided the small caravan and market about three miles upstream.

The raiders came soon after sunset, just ahead of the thunderstorm. More than two scores of orcs led by a cadre of hobgoblins. Bursting out of the woody marsh upstream of the market campground they quickly overwhelmed the few guards and other armed people among the tents and wagons. You and your current companions were near the boat, trading some goods and wares with the boat’s master, when the raid happened. Realizing that staying and fighting was sure way to die horribly, or be captured and enslaved in some hobgoblin mine, you and those near you pushed the boat out into the river, scrambled in, and sailed downstream. Only a few orcs pursued on foot, but they turned back after less than a mile, probably worried that they’d miss out on the plunder.

Now you and your fellows are on the bank of a swift rain swollen river, at the edge a forest, at night, during a downpour, and fleeing from inevitable pursuit. With that in mind, and only a few miles and a river between you and the orcs and hobgoblins, you head deeper into the trees, groping and stumbling along in the dark. Several hours and untold miles later, you break out of the trees and onto a wide swath that appears to be an ancient road.
