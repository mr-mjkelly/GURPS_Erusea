# Introduction

A keep run by a robber lord has been harassing honest travelers and merchants along a narrow road in Caledfaeth Forest. Known for charging outrageous tolls to cross a bridge over the wide stream below his keep, and suspected of having his retainers ambush selected parties further along the route, this lord effectively closed this particular route through the forest. Over time, the loss of revenue and trade caused the hamlet below his hilltop stronghold to dwindled until only a few desperate serfs remained, and those only for fear of being hunted by the retainers and killed.

One day one of those serfs arrives in the roadside village tavern babbling a tale about ogres and orcs and wolves and Dunrath Keep falling to a “mad orc lord” and villagers tortured and eaten.

# Background

Dunrath Tower was once a minor holding designed primarily to guard the bridge over the stream and collect tolls for those crossing it. As the region fell on hard times, the keep changed hands a few times, eventually ending up under the control of Arman Haldaeg, a disreputable but somewhat effective lord with a band of more than a dozen seasoned fighters, a compliant wizard, a sizable purse, and an interest in making the purse more sizable. Making the widow of the recently deceased local lord an offer she wisely did not refuse, he became the proud master of a keep and the hamlet in the meadow below it.

Haldaeg and his band wasted no time using the bridge to fill their treasury. Not content with reasonable tolls, they routinely shook down most travelers using the woods road, inspecting everything from merchant trains to farmer’s carts and taking what they chose. Merchants complained to local authorities, but none could really spare forces to deal with a lord who, after all, paid his own taxes on time and in full. Eventually a bard was delegated to appeal to the lord, and the tolls at the bridge became more reasonable. Less than a year later, brigands began plaguing traffic on the road little more than a day’s ride from the keep.

# Adventure Sites and Encounter Areas

## The Old Toll Bridge

This is located about four miles from the Dunrath hamlet and keep. The bridge is an old but still strong stone arch. On the northern side of the stream is a small moathouse with a walled courtyard, stables with four stalls, a common room and an upstairs barracks. The basement is only a simple storage room.

Two of Haldaeg’s men are kept here, in the basement storage area. One is badly hurt, having been mauled in a fight with the bugbear, and tortured after. The other is one of Haldaeg’s sergeant sorts, and if he gets some aid (especially some healing), he will at least impart some information about Corvus and his band. This sergeant, if he and his companion are healed and well treated, could be persuaded to help PCs against Corvus and perhaps rescue Haldaeg (or at least some of his hidden loot…).

## The Deserted Hamlet

- Where are prisoners kept? How are they guarded?
    
- The smithy is in use—perhaps audibly.
    

## The Tower

Dunrath Tower is a strong fort and well situated on a rocky spur below a steep hill. The approaches to the tower are steep on all sides and exposed to archery or other fire from the tower walls and turrets. A narrow ravine has been worked to smooth the approach to the keep, providing steps where the ascent is steep. The ravine passes under a gate tower that serves as a bastion. Beyond that tower’s gate is a wider area that acts as a courtyard, with stables, a well, and a forge located inside, set against the natural rock. Opposite the bastion gate is the keep’s gate tower, which provides entry into the donjon proper.

PCs would not be wise to try a direct assault into the keep. It should be made fairly obvious once they see the closed gates, notice a watch in the bastion keep, and perhaps take into consideration the fact that keeps of this sort are designed precisely to thwart such attacks. What PCs should do is seek another way in. It is possible that scaling a wall on the back or one of the blinder sides of the keep would be successful, but it is not likely that PCs will be equipped or skilled sufficiently for such a high-risk venture. Better still is for them to learn from someone in the hamlet of a secret passage that follows the strongly flowing springs up an into the keep.

These springs are a main source of water for the tower and the hamlet. The outlet in the hamlet commons is actually a springhouse with flowing water that overflows the cistern and pools outside the springhouse before flowing off gradually in the direction of the stream to the southeast. The same springs feed the wells in the keeps gateyard and in the donjon itself. Unbeknownst to either Haldaeg or Corvus, the original builders found and worked a secret passage to a series of chambers that were cut by running water long ago. This was intended to be an emergency escape should the keep be taken by enemies. One old woman remembers, and if rescued she can tell the PCs how to find it in the springhouse. Another person who knows an entrance is the blacksmith. There is a secret passage beneath a cistern in his forge. Corvus has kept him alive because smiths are useful, so he and an apprentice still work in the village. (Corvus has the smith’s daughter in the keep with him, also safe, to ensure that the smith does not flee the hamlet.)

[Note that in these secret chambers are also some even more secret vaults with some treasure.]

Among the various chambers in the dungeons beneath the keep is Sievar’s workroom and quarters, which he still occupies. Since they are behind a concealed door, Corvus’ brutes have not yet discovered them. The secret door from the caves along the spring leads to Sievar’s laboratory. His raven familiar will not be surprised by anyone entering, and will try to alert him if he happens to be awake.
