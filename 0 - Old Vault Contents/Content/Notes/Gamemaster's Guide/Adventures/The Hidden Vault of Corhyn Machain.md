# Background

A traveling peddler is found dead, killed after spending an evening by the fireside with PCs and other villages.

This adventure should be mostly a stand-alone affair (no greater implications for a wider campaign, although there may be some suggestive foreshadowing flavor elements pertinent to Arudan).

# Design Questions

Who killed the peddler? Well, in some cases PCs might be suspects if they are not established locals or otherwise above suspicion. In fact, it is a rogue who followed the peddler, then rode ahead and arrived in town ahead of him with the intent to steal the scroll.

Why was the peddler killed? Because he tried to sell a special rolled leather folio in a hardened boiled leather case to the wrong someone. The scroll holds directions to the vault of a long-dead noble — one who dabbled with dark arts.

How do PCs get ahold of the scroll? The peddler knew he was being stalked, and suspected the traveler. He slipped the scroll case into the belongings of one PC.

The scroll is a map. The journal has some instructions for finding the location of a secret magical key (secreted in a barrow in a stone circle just over a day’s journey from the village). It is guarded by some enchanted wolves.

# Background

Corhyn Machain was a seer to the king of Myrdha, one of the many petty kingdoms that came to be in the years after the fall of the High King. Using his arts and his vast knowledge on many subjects, he counseled two kings, father and son, and helped them maintain, grow, and nurture Myrdha into a prosperous and relatively peaceful and happy realm. Among his interests

More than a century ago, Machain vanished mysteriously, never to be heard from or seen again. 

There are many legends about the life and exploits of Corhyn Machain. According to most, he collected items of power and mystery, and supposedly he has caves, or in some versions a keep or remote castle, in which he stored many of these treasures. According to some versions of his legend, he sleeps in a hidden place awaiting a time of great need before waking to come to the aid of a great lord.
# Beginning the Adventure

  # The Tomb

In the barrow, along with a magical gold torc (some sort of defensive qualities, such as +1 AC and resistance to charm and sleep spells?), is the key: a triangular stone with rounded corners, sized to fit in a human palm. Symbols are etched into it: on one side, near each of the points, is a pictogram of the sun. At the point clockwise from the sun is a crescent moon pictogram. On the third point, counterclockwise from the sun, is a cluster of five stars. On the reverse side is a row of smaller versions of the same symbols.  

# The Vault

The vault, naturally, is in a dungeon, which will require two or three days travel, along a long abandoned road (now track along a strong stream). This should be a small dungeon, with few monsters, but some decent traps and other interesting features. The final vault should have some sort of guardian. It need not be lethal if the right conditions are met — a faithful, but not evil servant of some sort.

## General Features

![[FRPG_Dungeon_Floorplan_005_secret_vault.jpg]]

The natural caves are generally rough stone, with occasional indications of being crudely fashioned to clear the way, create rough steps, etc. While not flooded, the walls and floors are generally wet with condensation, and there are frequent puddles and occasional trickles of water seeping from higher altitudes or nearby springs.

The areas that have been constructed are primarily built from quarried granite common to the local region. The construction is typically rough-faced but well set stone.

1.  Entry
    
A narrow gap in the rock behind a strong waterfall leads into a small 10’ x 15’ natural cavern with a ceiling between 7’ and 10’ high. A small pool about 2’ deep at its center spans the entrance. Anyone wishing to enter the cave can slide in behind the deluge of the waterfall, but will still get wet. Torches are likely to be extinguished; lanterns will work normally. The floor and walls are rough and uneven, but do not make walking difficult. Toward the back of the cave, a flight of rough stone stairs climbs to the north along the east wall. The western side of the stairs is open to the cavern. There are some signs in the northwest corner of the cave that an animal had a den here, but the debris and bones are old, and it seems the animal is long departed.

2.  Narrow Stairs

These rough cut and somewhat irregular steps about 3’ to 4’ wide climb about 10’ before continuing through a narrow opening that is also about 3’ to 4’ wide. The stairs continue upward, turning slightly to the west, another 10’ or so.

1.  Trap → Swinging Spike: A long iron spike descends on a wooden arm from the ceiling to strike in the rough center of the passage at about 3 ½’ high. The trap is sprung by a pressure plate, which is DC 15 to spot. A DC 10 Intelligence check will allow a character to disable the trap by either triggering it while lying prone (thus causing it to miss), or by wedging something under the plate. In any case, once spotted, the trigger plate can be carefully stepped over. Anyone weighing more than 30 pounds passing over the plate location has a 3 in 4 chance of triggering the trap if not disabled or deliberately avoided. Once the trap is triggered, after a slight delay, the spike swings down. Given the delay, a creature may quickly drop prone, dodge to one side, or back up and make a DC 10 Dexterity check to avoid the trap. Players must specifically — and quickly -- state their action after hearing the noise of the spring mechanism to perform this evasion. If a character fails to evade the trap, the spike makes a melee attack at +3 to hit and does 1d6 hit points of damage on a hit.
2. Narrow ledge: This ledge 4’ to 6’ wide follows along the east wall. The drop off the edge on the west is 80’ to 100’ into a chasm through which a shallow but swift underground stream flows from north to south. A cool moist draft may make torches flutter a bit, but is otherwise just a breath of fresh air. Travel along this edge is manageable without technical methods or gear and, other than noted below, is not especially dangerous for adventurers.

1.  Ghorbats: Any light or disturbance greater than candlelight will arouse these two creatures who will rise from the chasm to defend their roost, their piercing high-pitched screech giving warning of their attack. They will attack until killed or wounded by more than half their hit points.
    
2.  Feature → Old Sword, Satchel: A rotted leather satchel with 40 gp, 100 sp, a silver cup with gold inlay and some garnets worth 50 gp total, as well as some moldy clothes, a 50’ rope (rotted), flint and steel, two torches, and some very expired provisions lies next to a rusted sword near some loose stone.
    
3.  Trap → Tilting Slide: Just to the north of the satchel is a section of the ledge that has been rigged to drop down, tilting on hidden hinges into the eastern wall. This 10’ section will drop when more than 50 pounds of weight reaches its center. Anyone or anything in the section must make a DC 15 Dexterity check to make an attempt to dive for either the northern or southern edge (DM choice or roll randomly). Success means that person can catch the edge and hang on; on a natural 20, the person actually jumps clear and lands to the north or south, entirely avoiding the fall or having to hang on for dear life. Anyone falling will suffer 8d6 hit point of damage. This trap is DC 15 to spot. A small stone nob on the east wall, quite near the satchel and sword, can be pushed in to disable the trap, and is also DC 15 to spot.
    

4.  Large Cavern
    

An irregularly shaped cavern with a cool, moist atmosphere and walls wet with condensation and reflecting light with small sparkles and glints.

Encounter ideas:

Shadow(s)

Of interest: a remarkably lifelike statue of a varghul (a winged ghoul with clawed feet for hanging upside-down and a somewhat bat-like features. Wings are also arms--this creature can glide downward or assist a jump upward, but cannot truly fly). This is in fact just a petrified varghul, something of interest to the former master of this vault.

5.  Inner Sanctum

Prism portal and three crystal balls — A large, ornate standing frame about 5’ tall stands on a 1 inch thick, 6 foot wide circle of polished onyx. The frame holds a great crystal the size of a large full-length mirror. The crystal is the color of a smoky quartz and is highly reflective. The frame is silver with some ornate gold filigree and a few emeralds set in the silver.

Anyone closely examining the framed crystal might notice that the smokiness moves and flows, and that there seems to be more depth to the crystal than its physical thickness in the frame. If anyone steps on the circle and examines the crystal or frame closely, it will activate and transport that person to a hillside crowned with a stone ring.

If the person transported carries one of the two smaller crystal balls sitting on a table in the sanctum, they can be located by the large crystal ball (on the same table) and brought back by anyone touching the large sphere with that intent.
