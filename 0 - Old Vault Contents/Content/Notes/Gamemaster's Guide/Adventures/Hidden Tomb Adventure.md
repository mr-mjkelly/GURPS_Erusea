## Background Notes

- The locals have known of the stones standing on a nearby hill for some time. It is a place the wise avoid (and, by extension, where only fools and gods dare tread). There are old tales of strange mists and apparitions in the vicinity of the dark stones (basalt?). Woodcutters, charcoalers, and hunters have even told of wandering spirits or strange moans calling them from their shelters and their fires. Some, it is said, succumbed and heeded these calls, never to be seen again in mortal life.

- Beneath the stones, undiscovered for untold, is an ancient tomb. Interred therein is an ancient lord whose greed and lust for power made him a tyrant and drove him to assassinate his king and try to usurp the throne by kidnapping the widow queen and her unborn child. Loyal subjects, heroic warriors, devoted druids, and the high priestess of the royal court, foiled the attempted usurpation and captured the usurper and his allies. Most of the traitors were condemned to death. Some, including the usurper himself, were  damned by a conclave of druids and cursed. Priests loyal to the tyrant and to the dark powers they served alongside him brought his corpse to this tomb complex, sealing themselves within.
    
- On certain nights, the undead usurper and his cadre can roam and seek living victims to feed on and temporarily sate their endless hunger.

# Adventure Beginning Notes

- Bad weather.
    
- PCs and many locals are eating, drinking, and staying warm by the two hearths of the Briar & Thistle inn & tavern. A traveling minstrel is telling tales and singing lays. The food, drink, and company are all good. In addition to the PCs, some fellow caravan travelers are taking their ease and enjoying meat and mead in warm comfort.
    
- About a half hour past nine, a local resident bursts into the tavern crying for help: his brother has been taken!

Even in the rain it is clear that the brother has moved toward the southwest, out of the village. Anyone pursuing soon and at a fast pace will catch up to the villein’s brother and his abductor about a mile and a half down the road. As they arrive, the blue-eyed minor draugr is dropping his most recent lifeless victim to the ground and, with a demonic grin, turns and stalks up the hill toward the standing stones.
