## Background

It's early April in the lands around Corraidhín Manor.

A small band of brigands has been plaguing locals and travelers since the last snows melted from the roads and lanes through the nearby forests. Many of the locals, including Brian, lord of Corraidhín, believe the brigands are operating out of a nearby ruined keep. Merchants and local village leaders are appealing to Brian to deal with the problem, but the lone lord only has a few men-at-arms in his household, and he is well aware that it would be foolhardy to take on a group of armed outlaws in their own forest stronghold.

More recent events, however, have put some pressure on Brian to act. The pending May nuptials of Bradán Donnchad, a strapping young apprentice armorer, and Ceinwen Angharad, a beautiful and popular local maiden. has been the subject of popular discussion for much of the winter and early spring. The would-be groom is apprenticed to none other than Brian's own armorer, Faolán, who is not only a long-time servant of house Corraidhín, but a friend of Brian as well. Brian has offered to host the wedding and feast at the manor house. Then, four days ago, Bradán was riding along with some merchants to bring a few wares to market when the brigands ambushed his party, taking only Bradán alive to ransom.

The abduction is a direct affront to Brian's honor and reputation, and he is as outraged as his people, many of whom are offering to arm and assist him in bringing the brigands to a harsh and just end. However, as angry as Brian is, his professional judgment keeps him from acting rashly. He has deputized a number of strong and capable villeins and permitted them arms to escort merchants and other travellers through his lands, and to guard some granaries and other stores from raids. However, he has refrained from sallying forth with his own men to bring the brigands to justice.

Brian suspects that a neighboring lord, Ranald, has a great deal to do with the brigands and their apparent focus on the lands of Corraidhín, and he realizes that much of Ranald’s objective is likely to provoke open conflict. Ranald has more lands, more money, and more men, and has long been interested in acquiring Brian's land. Moreover, he is younger than Brian by nearly twenty years, and has a fearsome reputation as a fighter. Brian did not reach his advanced maturity by being a vainglorious fool. He knows that the situation calls for a more subtle approach.

# Preliminaries

## A Meeting at a Tavern

At least one of the PCs is known to Ceinwen’s family as the sort who can solve some problems. Perhaps they are friends, or distant relations. However this works out with regard to character backgrounds, word reaches PCs that someone with interest in hiring them wishes to meet at a tavern less than a day’s ride from Corraidhín.

1.  The meeting is with Faolán, acting on behalf of Brian.
2.  The mission is primarily to rescue Bradán, if he is still alive; if he is not, his body should be recovered if possible.
3.  In addition to the rescue, Brian is interested in intelligence about the brigands, their hideout, etc.
4.  Note that the PCs are not expected to rid the fief of the bandit menace themselves, only to help start the process and effect a rescue or recovery of Bradán.
5.  Rewards: 150 sp per PC for the mission, plus another 200 sp to the party collectively for the successful return of Bradán, alive, or another 100 sp for his body. There are bounties: 200 sp for the brigand leader (alive) or 100 sp for his head. Note that if the PCs capture or kill Sir Ranald red-handed, there are other implications.
    
It is possible for PCs to negotiate other terms. Allow them to negotiate with Faolán using interpersonal skills. Reactions matter. For each increment of success, add +1 to the value of each reward if that is what is at stake. Faolán is also willing to provide some services, such as creating a chain hauberk of excellent quality to one PC in lieu of silver, or making one or more weapons.

1.  Loot from the brigand lair is fair game for the PCs, with the exception of Bradán’s personal effects, which should be returned to Faolán.
    
2.  Faolán can also be persuaded to “loan” some weapons, armor, minor general equipment, and a baggage pony for the mission. It is expected that armor and weapons be returned, if they survive intact, or be paid for or replaced after the mission. Items like rope, lanterns, torches, etc. are not expected to be returned.
    
If Faolán and the PCs reach an agreement, Faolán will invite them to the manor by noon the next day to finalize terms and plan the mission with the help of Brian and other advisors. After spending the day at the manor, PCs will be supplied, equipped, invited to supper and to stay the night. Early the following morning, they head out.

## Meeting with Brian at Corraidhín

# The Forest Road

## Fight at the Ford

Two villagers, a father and son, are fighting with five armed ruffians. The ruffians are outlaws, but not from the group run by Ranald. They have only meager belongings and, when confronted by armed and ready opponents, will not put up much of a fight before fleeing. The grateful villagers will invite PCs to their home in Whitestone Village.

# Whitestone Village

## The Grandmother’s Tale

The grandmother knows about the keep, and will chime in over the dinner or after dinner conversation if the keep comes up. Her memory is not precise, but her grandmother told her a story of a young maid who used to visit the tower for a tryst with her lover while he was stationed there. According to the story, the maid and her lover met in a secret place by a pool with a statue at the inlet spring. There, in a small cave that served as a springhouse, was a secret tunnel that led to the cellars beneath the tower.

# Egan’s Watch: The Ruined Watchtower

Notes:

- The tower of Egan's Watch is set high on a bluff overlooking a nearby valley. This tower is a true ruin. Only remnants of the stone foundation the ground floor remains. Shelter is poor, so the brigands are essentially camping in a walled enclosure. They even have some crude canvas tarps and loose planking set up to keep the rain off.
    
- The watchtower tunnel and secret cellars were once used as a treasury by a minor Kialti lord. Much of his treasure was used in a war to fight off the Aldran incursions into the region about a century ago, but some items remain as the lord and those of his clan who knew of this redoubt were defeated and slain before they could return. This should be a complex in disrepair, with some flooding due to seepage from the springs under the bluff. Obstacles to passage will provide some adventure and danger, but are not particularly lethal. There may be some creatures (spiders, centipedes…), but no undead or similar serious creatures.
    
- The hidden entrance to the keep’s dungeon cellars is now under water in a pool that has risen over the years since it was last used. Entrance will require PCs to dive underwater and negotiate the old hidden door, which is in a state of rot and disrepair. Somewhere in the passageway is a spring-loaded pointed iron bar designed to spear players. However, it is old and feeble, and will not do as much damage as it might have when is was new, and does 1d-3 impaling damage (as if by someone with a Strength of 8).
    
- Just before entering into the cellar vaults under the donjon is a pit trap. Allow PCs a chance to avoid falling into it using DX, with bonuses.
    

# GM Notes

Brian, Ranald, and various other NPCs are Aldrans, and as such are viewed as the “ruling class” even in this region, where the population is largely Kialti or mixed Aldran-Kialti. There is no real unrest or near revolt, but there is some tension and occasional conflict. Ranald is a more severe and haughty lord than Brian, and many of the local outlaws are desperate free folk who resort to raiding, thieving, and occasional reprisals against those who usurped their former place.

## Adventure Roadmap

### Tavern Adventure Hooks

Faolán approaches PCs (or at least one of them) and attempts to recruit them, making the offer.

-   Individual PCs may have local ties or other background details to which adventure hooks can be applied.
    
-   PCs can agree to attempt at least to locate Bradán. They do not need to deal directly with defeating the brigands.
    
-   Faolán will ask those who agree to the task to meet at the manor house and plan the venture with Brian. It is Brian who will make the contract and provide funds, etc.
    
- Ceinwen’s brother, Oan Angharad will escort the party to Whitestone Village.
    

### The Road to Egan’s Watch

-   It will take more than a day to get to Egan’s Watch. The first day will be travel to Whitestone Village, the home of Bradán and Ceinwen. PCs will be guests of Malo and Ceinwen’s father and mother, respectively.
