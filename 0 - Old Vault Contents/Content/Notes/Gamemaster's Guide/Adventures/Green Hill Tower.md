# Scenario

Some orcs led by a half-orc named Kurgash (he’s not shy about his name being known…) are marauding local villages and travelers to and from Base Town. PCs are entreated or otherwise incited to seek this brigands out and put an end to their mischief.
## Base Town

Base Town is a frontier town with a wooden palisade wall. With the outer wall is the main town. Farther uphill and encircled by the outer palisade is a stronger by smaller palisade with more towers. This is the seat of the town government and some of the more vital activities. The main structure in this area is a wooden and earthwork keep.

A father and son from a farm in a nearby village have come to appeal for help and will seek out any PCs they think might help. The local tavern keeper can help facilitate a meeting. The supplicant farmers will offer money, as much as 100 sp.

PCs can obtain most ordinary and decent adventuring equipment in Base Town, as well as mounts and even hirelings if they can afford such expenses.

From Base Town PCs can travel to a nearby village that was recently attacked and start investigating. There they can hear the local theory that the orcs are holed up in the distant Green Hill Tower.
## The Road to Green Hill Tower

A long disused track that was once a road to the tower serves as a trail for PCs to follow to the tower once they locate it. The party will have to travel some distance over broken farmland, a few rolling hills, and a few miles of forest before reaching a lakeside clearing with an overgrown statue of a some significant and long dead woman. The statue has been defaced with orc graffiti. The trail moves along the lake shore for about ¾ of a mile before veering off into the woods and over a hill.
### Hillside Tombs

A ghoul has recently started prowling this area and the tombs in the hillside just beyond. The ghoul has little treasure. The tombs are for ancient nobles and the site is considered sacred locally. PCs will know this if they are local, and it would be poor form for them to desecrate the site further by looting it for treasure, etc.

The ghoul is feeding on an orc’s corpse. If surprised, it will be actively gnawing on the remains; if not, it likely to stalk the PC party and attack at the earliest opportunity.

The ghoul came from the complex beneath Green Hill Tower, having been released by Kurgash’s acolyte accomplice.

There is a paralyzed orc nearby who will at some point moan or curse as he recovers from the paralysis. He is wounded, and can be caught and interrogated with little resistance. He will grudgingly confirm that knows the general location of the lair where Kurgash set up camp and, if promised healing by someone whose oath he trusts, will give up the lair.

### Orc Lair

The orcs are not in Green Hill Tower. They did, however, visit the tower, and that visit set several things in motion.

They are located in a ruined gatehouse that used to guard the road to the tower. The old stone walls are still mostly standing, but the roof has essentially collapsed. There are a few chambers on the ground floor, and a cellar complex and a natural cave with a few chambers, some water, etc.

Kurgash and the Mad Acolyte are hiding in one of the natural chambers. Kurgash will flee if he hears any combat, via a secret passage with two of his most loyal orcs and the item discovered in a vault at Green Hill Tower. The Mad Acolyte (a first level cleric of some evil cult) will remain to attack the party. There are only five other orcs in the complex, and two of them are wounded. They will occupy the main common room of the gatehouse, guarding the stairs to the cellars below.

PCs have an option to try and sneak in via a window and get down to the cellars via an old and mostly dry well, but they should be made to figure that out on their own and execute it using their skills and abilities.
## Green Hill Tower

Green Hill Tower is what remains of an old keep long abandoned by an ancient Kialti king. The rubble of a long fallen and, for a time, frequently scavenged, curtain wall surrounds the slightly more recognizable walls of a square tower. The donjon tower is a ruined shell with little more than the foundation of the old keep. The vaults beneath can be entered either via a passage at the bottom of an old well, or via a concealed door outside the keep (which, since it has been disturbed by Kurgash and company, is not hard to find). There should be some clue to the well entrance within the keep, such as signs that the orcs descended into the well. Only PCs who state that they search the draw off to the side of the keep will find signs that lead to the door there.

The deepest vault of the keep was built to serve as the final resting place of a particularly evil sorcerer-priest who once tried to overthrow the druids and king and rule over the surrounding lands. After he was defeated over two centuries ago, he was captured and executed. Knowing his remains and some of his possessions would be sought by his followers and others interested in his dark lore and arts, the king had this tower (a near ruin even then) rebuilt and a complex of vaulted passages and chambers built far below it to secure the the sorcerer’s urn and other items under guard. A special guard was set to garrison the tower and prevent anyone from looting the dread relics. Various wards and other measures were also set against intrusion by means other than physical.

Kurgash’s group broke the seals on this vault and released some ancient power that effectively deranged the Acolyte and animated some long-dormant undead (namely the ghoul and some skeletons). Kurgash took something from the vault that could prove dangerous in later adventures.
### Background

# GM Notes

- In terms of my milieu, this is primarily a Kialti hold, but it is in transition and has an Aldran lord and several Aldrans (including men-at-arms, etc.) in place. There is some social friction, but no outright hostility to speak of among the townsfolk.

Beyond the walls is another matter.

- The villagers offer of 100 sp as a reward is significant, and PCs will recognize this is more than most villages can afford without hardship. Mention this to players as part of their general local knowledge. Players can take the money, but if they do, the good will of local folks will not be as abundant. If they do not, some locals will perhaps loan a mount (at least for baggage) and some basic supplies.
