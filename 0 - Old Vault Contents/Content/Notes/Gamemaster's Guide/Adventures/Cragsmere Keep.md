A [[Brigand Knight|brigand knight]] and his band of 14 bandits are known to run the various roads in and around [[Aronel]], waylaying and looting honest (or less formidable dishonest) folk at will. Various townsfolk at inns and taverns suggest that PCs might deal with them, to the benefit of all good people. The brigands are thought to be using the ruins of Cragsmere Keep as at least one of their lairs.
