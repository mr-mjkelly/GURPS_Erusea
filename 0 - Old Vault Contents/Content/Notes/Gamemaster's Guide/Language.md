There is no common tongue, as such. People who conduct business, diplomacy, trade, and so on learn more than one language, or make use of translators. Scholars studying old tomes and scrolls have to translate and interpret the material, or seek the aid of those with the knowledge to do so. Magic spells and scrolls are written in various arcane languages and those who study written and spoken spells must know one or more of those languages. Sailors are known to have a _lingua nautica_; thieves in various guilds have one or more secret languages, though not necessarily a sophisticated one common to all thieves everywhere.

The Kialti language, with variations in dialect, naming, accent, etc. is common among the Kialti and their cousin cultures. In lands occupied and controlled by the Aldrans, the Aldrunaic language is preeminent. Both are spoken commonly in the border lands of the north.
