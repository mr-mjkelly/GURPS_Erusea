I decided today that I still want to pursue a GURPS fantasy campaign, and do not want to give up on a more advanced design concept for the ErusÃ«a milieu and campaign. My approach is going to be something I think of as "micro design" in that I am going to stay primarily focused on my Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition campaign, but will fiddle with working on the GURPS rules and material elements I want to include in my mileu, and the actual world and adventure content.

My overall goal is to start the campaign at a level somewhat higher than the typical D&D "first level" point, but also keep the overall feel of the campaign out of the realm of extreme D&D style high level play, where things not only tend to go awry, but also where I have no interest in running a game. I am very interested in slowing and "flattening" the PC advancement curve, especially in terms of physical ability, skill, and magical capability.
The fit and feel of the milieu, and the campaign, should have some "old school" dungeon delving elements, along with some wilderness adventure on land and sea, and some quests. In the long arc of the PCs stories (those who survive...), I hope to have some heroic deeds, a climax, and an epic conclusion.

Not to get too far head of myself, I think I'll start with some basic design concepts, treating some short adventures as sandboxes of a sort.
